Article 1. An action is the right given to every person,
to claim judicially what is due or belongs to him.
Action means also the exercise of that right, that is to say,
a judicial demand founded on a contract, or given by law,
by which the plaintiff prays that the person against whom
he proceeds, be ordered to do that which he has bound
himself towards him to perform.

OHAPTEE I.
OF THE GENERAL DIVISIONS OF ACTIONS.
§ 2. Actions are divided into several kinds:
The first divisioa of actions is into personal, real, and
mixed.
C. P. 96.
§ 3. A personal action is that by which a person pro
ceeds against one who is personally bound towards him,
either by a contract or by virtue of the law, in order to com
pel him to pay what he owes to him, or to perform what
he had promised.
This action is called personal, because it is attached to
the person bound, and follows him everywhere.
C. P. 26, 27; 6 N. S. 616: 2 L. 94; 4 L. 477; 10 L. 216; 6 A. 481:
15 A. 469.
§ 4. A real action is that which relates to claims
made on immovable property, or to the immovable rights to
which they are subjected.
The object of this action is the ownership or the posses
sion of such property; and they are, therefore, subdivided
into petitory and possessory actions.
C. P. 41, 61; 3 N. S. 652; 11 L. 517; 11 A. 568; 31 A. 55; 32
A. 535.
§ 5. The petitory action is that by which he who has
the property of a real estate, or of a right upon, or growing
out of it, proceeds against the person having the posses
sion, in order to obtain the possession of the immovable
property, or the enjoyment of the rights upon it, to which
he is entitled.
C. P. 43, 46.
§ 6. A possessory action is that by which one claims to
be maintained in the possession of an immovable property,
or of a right upon, or growing out of it, when he has been
disturbed; or to be reinstated to that possession, when he
has been divested or evicted.
C. C. 3455 (3418), 3456 (3419); C. P. 46.
§ 7. A mixed action is one which, in its nature, par
takes both of the real and of the personal action, such as
a claim for the ownership of real property, and also for the
fruits it has produced, or their value.
6 R. 466.
§ 8. The second general division of actions, classes
them into civil and criminal actions.
§ 9. A civil action is one which is brought for private
interest, such as a suit to obtain the payment of a sum due
the restitution of property, or reparation for an injury done
by words or action;
§ 10. A criminal action is one which is instituted in the
name of the State, by its proper officers, in order to obtain
the public reparation of any crime or misdemeanor. This
action comes under the head of penal jurisprudence.
§ 11. Actions, with respect to their object, are divided
into two classes; those by which movables, and those by
which immovables are claimed.
6 A. 354.
§ 12. Although incorporeal rights be not in reality
movables nor immovables, they are nevertheless placed by
law in one of those two classes.
Actions tending to recover an immovable, or a real right,
or a universality of things, such as an inheritance, are con
sidered as real ; while actions for the recovery of a movable
or of a sum of money, though accompanied with a mortgage
are not real actions.
C. C. 474 (466) 2010 (2005) et seq ; C. P. 41, 43, 61 : 4 L. 477 ;
17 L. 555; 12 A. 864; 31 A. 60, 141.
CHAPTEE II.
OF THE BULES APPLICABLE TO ALL CIVIL ACTIONS.
§ 13. The forms, the effects and the prescription of ac
tions, are governed by the law of the place where they are
brought : but contracts are governed by the law of the place
where they were entered into.
C. C. (10) ; 3 M. 583 ; 7 M. 213, 353 ; 11 M. 732 ; 2 N. S. 96
5 N. S. 585; 6 N. S. 631 ; 8 N. S. 8; 1 L. 225, 542 ; 2 L. 115 ; 5 L.
28: 7 L. 138; 11 L. 464; 12 L. 534 ; 13 L. 446 ; 14 L. 305 ; 17 L.
458 ; 7 A 272 ; 13 A. 355 ; 17 A. 236 ; 24 A. 579.
§ 14. Every obligation gives impliedly a right of ac
tion to enforce its execution; but the obligation and the right
of action do not always arise at the same time. Thus in
contracts to be performed at a future period, the obligation
which grows out of the contract, arises at the very moment
of making it, but the right of action growing out of it, arises
only when the stipulated term has arrived.
12 L. 511; 17 A. 183.
§ 15. An action can only be brought by one having
a real and actual interest which he pursues, but as soon as
that interest arises, he may bring his action.
4 M. 662; 9 M. 466; 3 N. S. 291, 392; 5 N. S. 512; 8. N. S. 509;
2 L. 263; 3 L. 431; 4 L. 230, 533; 5 L. 48; 10 L. 154; 13 L. 13; 14
L. 254, 448; 15 L. 369; 17 L. 152, 481; 18 L. 92; 1 R. 195, 470; 3 R.
99; 10 R. 128; 2 A. 97, 441; 4 A. 350; 14 A. 645, 798; 15 A. 116, 617;
18 A. 469; 19 A. 526; 30 A. 606, 808; 31 A. 74.
§ 16. In all actions which are to be brought at the
end of a stated period, the right of action subsists until the
last day has expired.
§ 17. Natural obligations give no right of action, but
what has been paid pursuant to those obligations is not sub
ject to repetition.
Those are natural obligations, for which the law■ gives
no right of action; they arise on contracts entered into by
persons who, though possessed of sound discretion and
judgment enabling them to make contracts, are neverthe
less disqualified by law from contracting, as are the con
tracts of married women made without the authorization of
their husbands.
C. C. 1757, (1750), 2302, (2279), 2302, (2280).
§ 18. He who pays through error what he does not owe,
has an action for the repetition of what he has thus paid, un
less there was a natural obligation to make such payment ;
but he must prove that he paid through error, otherwise it
shall be presumed that he intended to give.
§ 19. Obligations contrary to justice, good faith or good
morals, such as those by which a reward is promised to
another to commit a crime, give no right of action to either
party to enforce the execution of the contract.
But if the reward promised has been paid, no action can
be brought to obtain the repayment of the amount.
C. C. 1756 (1749), 1893 (1887) ; 6. M. 548; . 3 N. S. 47 ; 5 N. S.
210; 7 N. S. 423 ; 2 L. 263 ; 10 L. 333, 416 ; 21 A. 14, 18.
§ 20. He who has a right of action to claim what is due
to him, has a right yet more evident to use the same cause
of action as an exception, in order to preserve his rights.
3 L. Quse temporalia sunt ad agendum, perpetua sunt exoipiendum.
11 L. 101; 13 L. 159; 12 R. 472.
§ 21. Actions do not abate by the death of one of the
parties, after answer filed.
C. C. 945 (939^; C. P. 113; C. P. 120, 3S1; 4 M. 485; 6 L. 301;
11 L. 307, 360; 6 R. 44; 3 A. 547; 9 A. 463; 13 A. 303; 14 A. 600; 15
A. 508; 16 A. 162.
§ 22. Actions arising from obligations are the property
of him in favor of whom they have been contracted; they
are transmitted with his estate to his heirs, who may carry
them on in their own name.
6 L. 619; 9 A. 463.
§ 23. The universal successor, or successors by an
universal title of a deceased person, such as his heirs or
universal legatees, are entitled to the same actions and ex
ceptions, as the person to whom they succeed; but they can
not claim, on their own behalf, any right which he had not
himself, for this reason, that no one can transfer a better
title to another than that which he himself had.
2 L. 514; 29 A. 347.
§ 24. The rule laid down in the preceding article takes
place also with respect to the successors of a deceased per
son claiming a thing by virtue of a particular title; that is
to say, by sale, donation or legacy, but so far only as con
cerns the thing itself, of which the deceased has thus dis
posed of in their favor.
C. C. 2236 (2233), 2242 (2239) ; C. N. 1322.
§ 25. Heirs or universal legatees may be sued for civil
reparation of the injury caused by the crimes or misde
meanors of the deceased, whose succession they have ac
cepted, although no action was instituted for that purpose
against the deceased during his life, and although neither he
nor his heirs have been benefited by such an offence.
C. C. 2315 (2294), 3536 (3501); 30 A. 926.
CHAPTER III.
OF THE RULES PECULIAR TO THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIVIL
ACTIONS.
§ION I.
Of the Several Kinds of Personal Actions, and of the Rules
which Govern them.
§ 26. A personal action lies against him who has bound
himself towards another, personally and independently of
the property which he possesses.
C. P. 3; 10 L. 216.
§ 27. Such action can only be brought against the debt
or, or the obligor, or the person who directly represents
him, such as universal heirs, (" or heirs ") by a universal
title.
C. P. 3; 7 A. 70.
§ 28. Personal actions are grounded on one of the four
causes which give rise to personal obligations. The causes
are contracts, or quasi contracts, offences, or quasi offences.
§ 29. Personal actions arise from contracts, where one
has bound himself for his own advantage, as by selling, pur
chasing, hiring or letting, or by any like contracts.
C. C. 1760 (1753); 1 L. 36 ; 10 L. 164, 216.
§ 30. Personal actions arise from quasi contracts, when
they are grounded on the obligations imposed upon him
who has managed the affairs of another, without being au
thorized.
C. C. 2293 (2272) ; 7 N. S. 140; 11 L. 286 ; 2 R. 1 ; 5 R. 91.
§ 31. Personal actions arise from offences, as when one
has become liable to another for the injury he has inflicted
on him by some crime or offence, such as theft or slander.
C. C. 2315 (2294); 2 L. 94; 6 A. 354; 17 A. 33.
§ 32. Personal actions arise from quasi offences, when
the ground of action is the injury done to another by one
of those faults which are not considered as real crime s or
offences.
C. C. 2315 (2294) ; 7 N. S. 410 ; 8 N. S. 588 ; 7 L. 531, 586 ; 10 L.
131, 288, 581.
§ 33. Personal actions arising from contracts, are di
vided into direct and equitable actions.
§ 34. A direct, contradistinguished from an equita ble
action, is that which arises immediately from contracts, and
binds ipso facto all who have been parties to it.
C. C. 1889 (1883), 1890 (1884).
§ 35. An equitable action is that which does not imme
diately arise from a contract, but from equity in favor of a
third person, not a party to it, and for whose benefit cert ain
stipulations have been made ; thus, if one stipulated in a
contract entered into with another person, and as an expre ss
condition of that contract, that this person should pay a
certain sum on his account, or give a certain thing to a third
person, not a party to the act, that third person has an
equitable action against the one who has contracted th e
obligation, to enforce the execution of the stipulation.
§ 36. Certain contracts, from their nature, give rise to
two species of personal actions in favor of the contracting
parties ; one of these is likewise termed direct, in contradis
tinction to the other, which is called a contrary action.
§ 37. A direct action, in this acceptation, is that which
arises out of a contract at the very moment of its being
made, without the occurrence of any new cause since the
contract ; as. in the contract of loan termed commodat, where
the action arises in favor of the owner of the thing against
him to whom he has lent it, in order to recover it.
§ 38. The contrarij action is that which arises from
some cause which has occurred since the contract, and has
for its object the obtaining of some indemnity, such as the
action which the law gives to the borrower in the loan called
commodat for the recovery of the disbursements which he
has been obliged to make for the preservation of the thing
lent to him.
§ 39. It is of the essence of all synallagmatic contracts,
that is to say, of those which contain reciprocal obligations
between the parties, to give rise to two species of direct
actions.
Thus, in the contract of sale, the purchaser has an action
against the seller to compel him to deliver the thing sold,
and the vendor has likewise his action against the purchaser
to compel him to pay the price.
8 L. 1, 181 ; 10 L. 19 : 11 L 239.
§ 40. Personal actions, being attached to the person of
the debtor, may be brought against all his heirs, should he
die without having extinguished it; but each of them will
only be liable for the amount and portion which he has in
herited from the debtor's estate.
§ 41. A real action lies against him who, without having
contracted any obligation towards the plaintiff, is neverthe
less bound towards him, as possessor of the immovable
property of which that plaintiff claims the ownership or the
possession, or on which he claimp to exercise some immov
able right.
C. P. 4, 12; 17 L. 555 ; C. C. 3475 (343S).
§ 42. The real action gives the right to follow the thing
in whatever hands it may be found; but as relates to hy
pothecary actions, this rule is subject to some modifications
which are established in the paragraph which treats of that
action.
C. P. 4, 61 ; 4. L. 477 ; 4 A. 553 ; 13 A 2.
I I.
Of the Petitory Action.
§ 43. The petitory action, or one by which real property,
or any immovable right to such property may be subjected,
is claimed, must be brought against the person, who is in
the actual possession of the immovable, even if the person
having the possession be only the farmer or lessee.
24 A. 511 ; 27 A. 307 ; 33 A. 619.
But if the farmer or lessee of a real estate be sued for that
cause of action, he must declare to the plaintiff the name and
the residence of his lessor, who shall be made a party to the
suit, if he reside in the State, or is represented therein, and
who must defend it in the place of the tenant, who shall be
discharged from the suit.
§ 44. The plaintiff in an action of revindication must
make out his title, otherwise the possessor, whoever he be,
shall be discharged from the demand.
7 L. 37 ; 8 L. 234, 321 ; 10 L. 350 ; 9 R. 216, 371 ; 12 A. 5 : 14
A. 232, 661, 777 ; 15 A. 76, 169, 444 ; 18 A. 197 ; 23 A. 145, 499 ; 32
A. 697.
§ 45. The petitory action may be brought by one who
has the ownership only of an undivided part of an estate,
or of a real right to which such an estate is subjected,
though his ownership may be limited to a certain period, or
end by the occurrence of a certain event.
RN. S. 171; 14 A. 537.
5 II.
Of the Possessory Action, and of the Rules which Govern it.
§ 46. The possessory action, which is a branch of real
actions, may be brought by any possessor, of a real estate,
or of a real right, who is disturbed either in the possession
of the estate or in the enjoyment of the right, against him
who causes the disturbance, in order to be maintained in, or
restored to the possession, whether he has been evicted or
disturbed, provided his possession be accompanied by the
qualifications hereafter required.
C. P. 6, 58 ; 5 N. S. 233 ; 8 N. S. 171 ; 7 N. S. 487 ; 2 L. 227 ; $
L. 415; 6 L. 56, 58, 559; 7 L. 155, 415; 9 L. 153; 10 L. 140, 442,
465; 12 L. 2 ; 10 A. 508 ; 14 A. 732, 849 ; 15 A. 685 ; 24 A. 176.
§ 47. The possessors entitled to bring these actions,
are those who possess as owners.
Persons entitled to the usufruct, or to the use of a real
estate, and others having real rights growing from such real
estate, may also bring their action, when disturbed in the
enjoyment of their rights.
2 L. 227 ; 7 L. 6 ; IR. 142, 159 ; 6 R. 100 ; 7 R. 149 ; 10 R.
407 ; 2 A. 357 ; 12 A. 203 ; 20 A. 339, 340 ; 32 A. 130, 697.
§ 48. Those who possess in the name of another, such
as tenants, are not entitled to the possessory action, when
disturbed in the enjoyment of the real estate which they
possess in that quality, or even when they are expelled; but
they have their remedy against the person in whose name
they possess, and they are bound to apprise him of the dis
turbance they have experienced, by personal notice, if he be
within the State, and by advertisements in the newspapers,
if he be out of the State, in order that he may quiet them if
it can be done; otherwise they lose all right to claim damages
from him, and will be liable to him besides for all the loss
and damages which he may have sustained through their
neglect.
C. C. 2696 (2666), 2724 (2694) ; C. P. 52 ; 10 R. 407 ; 2 A. 357;
31 A. 67.
§ 49. In order that the possessor of a real estate or
one who claims a right to which such estate may be sub
jected, may be entitled to bring a possessory action, it is re
quired:
1. That he should have had the real and actual possession
of the property at the instant when the disturbance oc
curred; a mere civil or legal possession is not sufficient.
2. That he should have had that possession quietly and
without interruption, by virtue of one of the titles prescribed
in the 47th Article, for more than a year previous to his
being disturbed provided the possession of less than one
year be sufficient, in case the possessor should have been
evicted by force or by fraud.
3. That he should have suffered a real disturbance either
in fact or in law.
4. That he should have brought his suit, at the latest,
within the year in which the disturbances took place.
When the possession of the plaintiff is accompanied with
all those circumstances, it matters not whether he possesses
in good or in bad faith, or even as a usurper, he shall never
theless be entitled to his possessory action.
§ 50. The disturbance which gives rise to the posses
sory action may be of two kinds : disturbance in fact, or
disturbance in law.
C. P. 298 $ 5.
§ 51. Disturbance in fact occurs when one, by any
act, prevents the possessor of a real estate, or of a right
growing from such an estate from enjoying the same quietly,
or throws any obstacle in the way of that enjoyment, or
evicts him through violence, or otherwise.
§ 52. Disturbance in law takes place when one, pre
tending to be the possessor of a real estate, says that he is
disturbed by the real possessor, and brings against the lat
ter the possessory action; for, in such a case, the true pos
sessor is disturbed by this action, and may also bring a pos
sessory action, in order to be quieted in his possession.
But in no case shall the mere demand in revendication
of a real estate, or of a real right, be considered as a dis
turbance in the enjoyment of a possessor, and entitle him to
bring a possessory action.
C. P. 48.
§ 53. The plaintiff in a possessory action needs only, in
order to make out his case, to prove that he was in posses
sion of the property in question, in the manner required by
this Code, and that he has been either disturbed or evicted
within the year previous to his suit.
So that when the possession of the plaintiff, or the act of
disturbing him is denied, no testimony shall be admitted,
except as to the fact of the possession, or as to the act of
disturbance, and all testimony relative to property shall be
rejected.
§ 54. If the possessor, who has been disturbed in, or
evicted from his possession, bring a petitory action, that is
to say, claim the ownership of the property, he shall not
afterwards be entitled to the possessory, by dismissing the
petitory action.
The same rule shall govern, if he sue at the same time
for the possession and the ownership of the property ; he
shall then be considered as having renounced the possessory
in order to resort to the petitory action.
C. P. 150, 152.
§ 55. Petitory and possessory actions shall not be
cumulated and joined together, except by consent of parties.
therefore, he who is sued in a possessory action, can not
bring a petitory action, until after judgment shall have been
rendered in the possessory a.ction, and until, if he has been
condemned, he shall have satisfied the judgment given
against him.
C. P. 149, 150.
§ 56. Nevertheless, if the judgment rendered in a pos
sessory action require a settlement, which may occasion
delay, then the judge shall fix a term for making such settle
ment, at the end of which the petitory action may be brought.
§ 57. If the plaintiff in a possessory action, consent
that it be cumulated with the petitory action, he shall be
considered as having renounced the possessory action, and
the judgment shall decide only the question of ownership.
C. P. 150.
§ 58. When each of the parties, in a possessory action,
alleges that he has the possession of the property, and both
of them bring suit on the allegation of having been disturbed
in their possession, if the fact of the possession be doubtful
and uncertain, the judge shall maintain in possession the one
of the parties who shall appear to him to have the most appa
rent possession, or he may, at the request of one of the
parties, order the sequestration of the property until the
question of ownership shall have been decided.
C. C. 2979 2948); C. P. 53, 274; 7 L. 1; 2 A. 219; 12 A. 397; 14
A. 345.
§ 59. If one who is disturbed in, or evicted from his
possession, suffer a year to elapse without bringing a pos
sessory action, that action shall be prescribed, and he must
then resort to a petitory action.
C. C. 3536 (3501) ; C. P. 49, 53 ; 12 A. 397.
§ 60. Possessory actions can not be maintained for
personal property ; the action in revendication for that
species of property having nothing in common with the ex
traordinary privileges secured to the owners of real estate,
or of real rights, when they are disturbed in their enjoyment.
13 A. 104 ; 16 A. 187; 32 A. 697.
{ III.
Of the Hypothecary Action and of its Rules.
§ 61. An hypothecary action is a real action, which the
creditor brings against the property which has been hypothe
cated to him by his debtor, in order to have it seized and
sold for the payment of his debt.
C. C. 3399 (3362); C. P. 4, 42; 4 L. 452; 11 R. 209; 1 A. 204;
13 A. 2 ; 15 A. 104 ; 16 A. 187; 20 A. 405; 31 A. 60, 140.
§ 62. The hypothecary action, like all real actions, fol
lows the property to which it is attached, in whatever hand
it may be found, but it is subject to different rules, according
as the property may be in the possession of the debtor, of
his heirs, or of third persons.
C. C. 3399 (3382) ; 5 N. S. 50 ; 4 L. 447 ; 9 L. 1 ; 10 L. 490 ; 11
L. 419; 1 A. 204; 12 A. 551; 24 A. 553; 31 A. 140.
§ 63. When the hypothecated property is in the hand
of the debtor, and when the creditor, besides his hypothe
cary right, has against his debtor a title importing a
confession of judgment, he shall be entitled to have the
.hypothecated property seized immediately and sold for the
payment of his debt, including the capital, the interest and
the costs, pursuant to the rules provided hereafter for
executory proceedings.
C. C. 3398 (3361) ; C. P. 98, 732 ; 4 N. S. 196 ; 8 L. 257 ; 11 L.
50 ; 13 L. 512 ; 16 L. 223 ; 1 R. 295 ; 11 R. 209; 1 A. 204, 279 ; 20
A. 405 ; 23 A. 339.
§ 64. If the creditor has no executory title against his
debtor, and the latter be in possession of the hypothecated
property, the former can only seize and sell such property,
after having obtained judgment against the debtor in the
usual form.
2 L. 132 ; 6 L. 50 ; 11 R. 209 ; 1 A. 204 ; 21 Wallace, 134.
§ 65. If the debtor has died, leaving a single heir, who
has accepted the succession, the hypothecatory creditor may
act against that heir, in the same manner as he would have
done against the debtor himself, that is to say, either by
pursuing the executory or the ordinary mode of proceeding,
according to the tenor of the hypothecary act.

§ 66. If, on the contrary, the deceased debtor leaves
several heirs, and they have accepted the succession, in such
a case it must be ascertained whether the hypothecary act
imports a confession of judgment or not.
If so, and there have been no partition of the estate
among the heirs, the creditor shall be entitled to seize and
sell the hypothecated property, as if the original debtor
were still alive.
But if there has been a partition among the heirs, and the
hypothecated property has fallen to the share of one or
more of them, the creditor may obtain an order of seizure
against those heirs, and sell the property for the amount of
his claim, leaving to them their recourse against their co
heirs for their proportion of the debt.
C. P. 121; 1 A. 204; 12 A. 164; 14 A. 567 ; 21 A. 486.
§ 67. But if the hypothecary act do not import con
fession of judgment, the creditor cannot seize and sell the
hypothecated property in the possession of the heirs of his
debtor, or of any one of them, until he has obtained a judg
ment against each one of the heirs, for such a part of the
debt as he is bound to pay, according to the share he has
inherited, unless the creditor prefer to have the judgment
executed personally against the heirs or their property, for
such sums as each of them has been adjudged to pay.
C. P. 121; 1 A. 204; 12 A. 164; 14 A. 567.
§ 68. If the hypothecated property be neither in the
possession of the debtor nor of his heirs, but in that of a
third person, the creditor has his action against that person ,
in order to compel him either to give up the property or pay
the amount for which it stands hypothecated. This is the
hypothecary action, properly speaking.

§ 69. If, thirty days after the amicable demand, made
from the debtor or his heirs, of the payment of an hypothe
cary debt, it has not been fully discharged, the creditor may
bring his action against the third possessor of the property
hypothecated to him, to have it seized and sold, if that third
possessor have not, within the ten days, after having been
notified of such a demand, paid the amount of the hypothe
cary debt, including the interest and cost.

15 A. 104, 564 ; 16 A. 187 ; 24 A. 552, 566 ; 30 A. 1190.
§ 70. But the creditor who brings this action must de
clare on oath, in the petition, that the debt for which he de
mands the seizure of the hypothecated property is really due
to him, and that he has in vain demanded payment from his
debtor thirty days previous to his bringing his suit.

§ 71. Nevertheless, if the third possessor, against whom
the action is brought, be not personally bound for the pay
ment of the debt, he may oppose the sale of the hypothe
cated property, if there be other hypothecated property in
the possession of the original debtor, and require its pre
vious discussion, pending which the proceedings as to the
sale of the property shall be stayed.

§ 72. The third possessor, who requires discussion,
shall be bound to designate to the plaintiff the property of
the principal debtor, which be wishes to have discussed, and
advance the costs required for carrying on the necessary.
proceedings, in order to execute this discussion.
He is not entitled to demand the discussion of such prop
erty of the principal debtor, which may be out of the juris
diction of the tribunal of the place where the payment was
to have been made, nor that of property in dispute, or out
of the possession of the debtor.

to the privileged creditor, or to one who has a special
hypothecation.

§ 74. Third possessors of property which has been
seized, owing to their failure of discharging the amount of
the hypothecary debt, within ten days after having been
notified that payment has been demanded of the hypothe
cary debt, may, until the very day of the sale, recover pos
session of the hypothecated property, by paying the debt
■with interest, and all the costs incurred in the suit.
§ 75. Actions must be brought before competent
judges.
9 R. 500; 15 A. 19, 27.
§ION I.
Of Judges ; their Jurisdiction ; how their Competency is
Regulated.
§ 76. Jurisdiction means the power of him who has the
right of judging; or sometimes that word means also the
space or extent of country over which the judge is entitled
to exercise that power.
8 A. 277; 15 A. 636; 17 A. 70; 22 A. 570; Act 1870, No. 86.
§ 77. Degrees of jurisdiction mean the different tribu
nals before which the same suit may be successively pleaded,
and the rules established for proceeding in an inferior juris
diction previous to taking the suit before a superior jurisdic
tion.
§ 78. There are several kinds of jurisdictions, accord
ing to the nature and the extent of the powers delegated to
the j udge exercising it.
§ 79. The first division is into civil and criminal juris
diction.
§ 80. Civil jurisdiction extends to all civil matters, and
criminal jurisdiction comprises whatever relates to crimes
and misdemeanors.
§ 81. Some judges exercise general, whilst others pos
sess only special jurisdiction.
Judges having general jurisdiction are those who, in vir
tue of the law, take cognizance of all matters but such as
are specially excepted from their jurisdiction.
Judges having special jurisdiction are such as have an
exclusive jurisdiction in certain cases pointed out by law.
§ 82. There are judges having exclusive jurisdiction,
such as the special judges mentioned in the preceding
§cle.
There are judges with concurrent jurisdiction, that is to
say, having cognizance in matters of the same nature, though
they hold their courts in the same place or district.
§ 83. There are judges having equal jurisdiction, that
is to say, that though they can only take cognizance of cases
arising within a certain space, they have a similar jurisdic
tion as to the nature of cases which may be brought before
them.
§ 84. There are judges of original, and judges of appel
late jurisdiction.
Judges having original jurisdiction are those before whom
suits are brought in the first instance.
Judges having appellate jurisdiction are those before
whom appeals are brought by those who complain of the
judgment of the court of the first instance, and who try the
cause again, affirming or reversing the judgment of the
inferior court.
§ 85. The decision of some judges is subject to appeal;
others decide in the last resort.
Judges subject to appeal are those whose decisions may
be carried by appeal before a superior court having appel
late jurisdiction.
Judges in the last resort are those whose judgment can
not be appealed from.
§ 86. In matters of jurisdiction, the right given to a
judge to take cognizance of certain causes against certain
persons within his jurisdiction, is termed competency.
§ 87. In order to ascertain whether a judge be com
petent or not, three points must be taken into consideration.
1. The object or the amount in dispute.
2. The person of the defendant.
3. The place where the action is to be brought.
§ 88. To determine on the competency of a judge, as
relates to the object or amount in dispute before him, it is
necessary to examine what are his powers, what is the
nature of the cause, and what is the amount of the sum.
14 A 851; 21 A. 754; 31 A. 55.
§ 89. To determine his competency, as relates to the
person of the defendant, the rule which requires that the
defendant be sued at the place of his domicile or usual
residence, must be observed. This rule is subject, however,
to various exceptions, determined in the chapter which treats
of judicial demands and of citations.
C. P. 162; 1 L. 223 ; 6 R. 6; 9 A. 178; 14 A. 300; 16 A. 8, 29 A.
8; 31 A. 507, 583; 32 A. 282.
§ 90. To determine on his competency, as relates to the
place where the action is brought, we must be governed by
the rule which. provides that a judge shall not exercise any
jurisdiction beyond the limits of the territory assigned to
him.
C. P. 162.
§ 91. When the jurisdiction of the judge, before whom
a suit is brought, is limited to a certain sum, the question of
jurisdiction must be decided by the amount claimed, and not
by the sum actually due, not including, however, the inter
est and the costs which have been subsequently incurred.
But if one, in order to give jurisdiction to a judge, demand
a sum below that which is really due to him, he shall be pre
sumed to have remitted the overplus, and after having ob
tained judgment for the sum he had claimed, he shall lose
all right of action'for'that overplus.
C. P. 156; 2 E. 207 ; 5 R. 90; 32 A. 49.
§ 92. The consent of parties can not render a judge
competent to try a cause, which from its nature can not be
brought before him, or when the amount in dispute exceeds
the sum over which he has jurisdiction. All judgments ren
dered in contravention of this provision, shall be void.
§ 93. If one be cited before a judge, whose jurisdiction
does not extend to the place of his domicile, or of his usual
residence, but who is competent to decide the cause brought
before him, and he plead to the merit, instead of declining
the jurisdiction, the judgment given shall be valid, except
the defendant be a minor.
C. P. 162: 2 L. 224; 11 R. 77; 18 A. 89; 24 A. 51G; C. P. 162;
Act 1861; 23 A. 658; 29 A. 194; 31 A. 89; 33 A. 658.
§ 94. The same cause can not be brought before two
separate courts, though they be possessed of concurrent
jurisdiction, except by discontinuing the suit first brought
before the answer is filed.
Hence, if the same suit be brought before two separate
courts, having concurrent jurisdiction, the judge, before
whom the action was brought first, shall sustain his juris
diction, and the defendant shall bj entitled to have the
cause dismissed by the other court, and to recover costs.
Nevertheless, if the defendant, instead of claiming to be
dismissed, answer in the two actions, in the two separate
courts, the first judgment rendered by either of them shall
be valid and executory against the party cast in the action.
All proceedings shall be stayed in the other court, and the
plaintiff dismissed after paying the costs.
C. P. 335, 492, 5 52 ; 14 A. 583.
§ION II.
Of the Mode of Bringing Civil Suits, of Suits, and of
Parties Litigant.
§ 95. Actions are brought before the courts by what is
termed suit.
Aet. 96. A suit is a real, personal or mixed demand, made
before a competent judge, by which the parties pray to ob
tain their right, and a decision of their disputes.
In that acceptation the words suit, process and cause are
almost synonimous.
C. P. 2.
§ 97. Civil actions may be prosecuted, according to the
nature of the case, by three kinds of proceedings, to-wit :
Ordinary, executory or summary.
8N. S. 95; 12 A. 642.
§ 98. The proceedings are ordinary, when citation takes
place, and all the delays and forms of law are observed.
They are executory, when seizure is obtained against the
property of the debtor, without previous citation, in virtue
of an act or title importing confession of judgment, or in
other cases provided by law.
They are summary, when carried on with rapidity, and
without the observance of the formalities required in ordi
nary cases, as when courts provide for the administration of
vacant successions, and the property of minors and absent
heirs.
C. P. 63, 732, 754; 8 L. 257; 3 A. 434; 12 A. 642; 17 A. 315.
§ 99. In order to constitute a suit or action, there must
be at least two parties present or duly represented, though
one of the two may fail to appear; it is therefore that they
are called the principal parties to the suit.
C. C. 2085 (2080; 6 N S. 517: 4 L. 158; 5 L. 424; 17 L. 479; 15
A. 509; Acts 1871, No. 103; 30 A. 692.
§ 100. The plaintiff is he who sues another for some
thing which he says is due, or belongs to him.
The defendant is one against whom this suit is brought.
14 A. 681; 15. A. 244.
§ 101. Besides the plaintiff and the defendant, there are
often other parties to the suit, such as warrantors, third
persons intervening and parties opposing; but such parties,
whether plaintiffs or defendants, as the case may be, are
only so incidentally and subsidiarily.
§ 102. Those who are disqualified from contracting are
generally disqualified from suing.
The exceptions to this rule are provided in the following
§cles.
7 A. 116; 15 A. 492, 582, 713.
§ 103. No disqualifications to bring actions can arise on
account of race, color or previous condition.
§ 104. Children, as long as they are subject to paternal
power, that is to say, while their lathers and mothers are
living, and they, not emancipated, can not bring suit against
them.
§ 105. A married woman can not sue her husband as
long as the marriage contiuues, except it be to obtain a sep
aration from bed and board, or for the separation of prop
erty, or for the restitution and enjoyment of her paraphernal
property, or in case she holds her property separate from
him by her marriage contract, or for divorce ; but in no case
can she sue her husband, without the authorization of the
court before which she brings her action.
§ 106. A married woman, whether she be of age, or a
minor, can not appear in court against any one, without the
authorization of her husband, although she may be a public
merchant, carrying on her trade separate from him, unless
she has obtained a separation from bed and board, by virtue
of a judgment duly executed, or has been regularly divorced.
§ 107. Husbands have, under their control, the per
sonal and possessory actions to which their wives are entitled
though they be themselves minors; therefore, they can pro
ceed judicially, and in their own name, in whatever relates
to the preservation of the dotal property, which their wives
have brought to them by marriage, as well as to the recov
ering of the debts due them, these being under their admin
istration.
But actions, relating to the ownership of the dotal or par
aphernal property of the wife, or of some real right belong
ing to her, must be brought by the wife, duly authorized by
her husband, or by the judge, if he fails to do it.

ings, in the name of their minors, and in all suits which may
be brought for them, without making them parties to said
suits.
The curators of persons interdicted, or absent, act judi
cially in the name of those they represent, in the same man
ner as the tutors of minors.
§ 110. The minor husband emancipated by marriage,
can bring suit without the assistance of any curator.
§ 111. The curators of vacant successions or of absent
heirs, may bring all kinds of actions relating to their admin
istration, in their own name and in their quality, without
being obliged to mention the name of the heirs they repre
sent, because it is often uncertain whether such heirs exist,
and their names are generally unknown.

passes to the heirs; therefore, the heirs of the deceased may
sue the debtor of the succession in the same manner as the
deceased himself could have done.
But, actions being divisible, if there be several heirs, each
may sue for his separate share, in the same manner, as each
is only bound pro rata of his share for the debts of the suc
cession.

CHAPTER VI.
AGAINST WHOM ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT.
§ 114. Civil actions may be brought against minor hus
bands, emancipated by marriage.
§ 115. Actions against interdicted persons or minors,
must be brought directly against the tutor of the minor or
the curator of the interdicted person.
§ 116. If the minor, against whom one intends to insti
tute a suit, has no tutor, the plaintiff must demand that a
curator ad hoc be named to defend the suit. The same course
must be pursued if the person intended to be sued be ab
sent and not represented in the State.
§ 117. When the tutor of a minor has interests opposed
to those of his ward, he can not sue him, except by making
the undertutor defendant in the cause.
§ 118. When one intends to sue a married woman for
a cause of action relative to her own separate interest, the*
suit must be brought both against her and her husband.
Should her husband be absent, the plaintiff must demand
that she be authorized by the judge before whom the suit is
brought to defend it alone.
Nevertheless, if she be divorced or separated from her
husband, from bed and board, by a judgment duly executed,
she may be sued alone without the authorization of her hus
band or of the judge being required.
§ 119. Suits against corporations, corporate bodies, or
chartered companies, must be brought against them under
their legal titles.
C. P. 112, 198; 29 A. 658.
§ 120. If one against whom there was a cause of action,
die, leaving one heir only, the suit shall be carried on against
such heir as it would have been against the deceased.
If the suit had already been brought against the de
ceased, and he had not answered, it shall not be interrupted,
but shall be continued against the heir by a mere citation or
notice served on him to that effect, within the delay for
original citations, according as the d.stance may be from his
domicile to the court where the action has been brought.
If, on the contrary, the deceased have two or more heirs,
the plaintiff may proceed personally against each of them
for the share which he inherits, if that share be sufficiently
known and ascertained by an inventory or partition ; other
wise they can only be sued each for a virile portion, that
is to say, for an equal part of the debt, dividing it in as many
parts as there are heirs.
If the suit had been already commenced against the de
ceased, it shall be continued against his several heirs by
citing each of them separately as if there were only one ; but
judgment can only be givea personally against each for his
hereditary share, or virile portion as above provided.
All suits brought against curators and other administra
tors during the time of their administration, shall, after the
expiration of their time, and even after they have rendered
their accounts to the heirs, be continued and tried without
any additional formality, except that of making the heirs
parties, which shall be ordered by the court on motion of
any one of the parties, or on application of such heirs them
selves.
§ 121. The hypothecary creditors of a person deceased
have, besides their action against each of his heirs, as pro
vided in the preceding article, an hypothecary action against
such of the heirs who have possession of some property
subject to their hypothecation.
This action lies for the whole amount of the debt, whether
the heir thus sued possesses the whole or only a part of
the hypothecated property; he has, however, his recourse
against his co-heirs for the share which they are bound to
contribute towards the payment of the debt.
The heir against whom the hypothecary action is insti
tuted may be discharged by relinquishing such hypothecated
property as may have fallen to his share, if there has been
a partition, or his undivided share of such property, if the
property has not been divided.
But this relinquishment shall not free the heir from his
liability to the personal action in case the creditor should
prefer to proceed against him directly, rather than to resort
to the hypothecary action, or in case the proceeds of the
sale of the hypothecated property should be insufficient to
discharge the debt.
C. P. 65, 66, 67.
§ 122. All kinds of actions may be brought against
vacant successions, when all the heirs are absent, and not
represented in the State, provided they be instituted against
the curator appointed to administer the succession.
The judgments rendered against the curator are as valid
and efficacious as if they had been rendered against the
heirs themselves.
But if some of the heirs of the deceased are present, or
represented in the State, the suit must be brought against
the heirs present or represented, as well as against the
curator of those who are absent.
C. C. 51 (54); 2 L. 255 ; 3 L. 277; 7 R. 206; 8 R. 488; 14 A. 336.
Acts 1855, p. 76; C. P. I11; C. C. 1155 (1146).
§ 123. Testamentary executors may appear and defend
all the actions brought against the succession they admin
ister, when none of the heirs are present or represented in
the State; but if all the heirs, or any one of them, be pres
ent or represented, none but personal actions can be brought
against the testamentary executor alone. All real actions,
such as those of revendication and the like, must be brought
both against the testamentary executor and the heirs pres
ent or represented.
§ 124. The rules of proceedings, contained in the pres
ent title, relate only to the district and parish courts of the
State, when in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction.
Special rules are hereafter established for courts of pro
bate, and justices of the peace.
C. P. 921 et seq., 1061 et seq.
CHAPTER I.
OF COUBTS OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION AND THEIR POWERS.
§ 125. The limits of the territorial jurisdiction of the
several district and parish courts in this State are estab
lished by special statutes.
§ 126. The original jurisdiction of the district courts
extends to all civil cases, when the amount in dispute ex
ceeds five hundred dollars, exclusive of interest; and appel
late jurisdiction in civil ordinary suits, when the amount in
dispute exceeds one hundred dollars, exclusive of interest.
In the parish of Orleans the district courts have the follow
ing jurisdiction:
The First, exclusive criminal jurisdiction; the Second, ex
clusive probate jurisdiction; the Third, exclusive jurisdic
tion of appeals from the justices of the peace, and to re
strain and enjoin seizures made under orders issued by
justices of the peace for said parish, whether the same be
made under mesne process or execution, when the value of
the property seized exceeds one hundred dollars. It has
equal and concurrent jurisdiction with the Fourth, Fifth,
Sixth and Seven District Courts of the parish of Orleans in
all suits, matters and proceedings, In which a judgment in
money is not demanded, and to try all cases of Interdiction,
and suits fcr separation of bed and board or divorce, and act
in cases of emancipation of minors, when it has jurisdiction
.of the person. The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Dis
trict Courts have exclusive jurisdiction in all civil cases, ex
cept probate, when the sum in contest is above one hundred
dollars, exclusive of interest ; and concurrent jurisdiction
■with the Third District Court, in all cases of interdiction, and
suits for separation from bed and board, or divorce, and act
in cases of emancipation of minors, when they have jurisdic
tion of the person.
The judgment of district courts are final in all causes on
appeal from the parish courts. In all causes of which they
have original jurisdiction an appeal lies from their judgment.
In the parish of Orleans, the judgments of the district courts
are final in all causes, where the sum in dispute does not ex
ceed five hundred dollars.
An appeal lies directly to the Supreme Court In all cases
in which the constitutionality or legality or any tax, toll or
impost of any kind or nature whatsoever, or any fine, for
feiture or penalty, imposed by a municipal corporation, shall
be in contestation, whatever may be the amount thereof.
Whenever a conflict of privileges arises between different
creditors, all the suits and claims shall be transferred to the

CHAPTER II.
OF THE ORDINARY PROCEEDINGS.
§ 146. The word proceeding, in its general acceptation,
means the form in which actions are to be brought and de
fended, the manner of intervening in suits, ot conduct>ng
them, the mode of deciding them, of opposing judgment, and
of executing them.
The forms are different in ordinary, executory, and sum
mary proceedings.
15 A. 310 ; 21 A. 653, 654 ; 32 A. 705.
§ION I.
Of Demand and of Cumulated Actions.
§ 147. A demand means a civil action brought before a
court of justice to obtain a thing to which one thinks him
self entitled.
15 A. 310.
§ 148. Separate actions may be cumulated in the same
demand, except in the cases hereafter expressed ; this is
termed cumulation of actions.
C. P. 422 ; 14 A. 364, 615 ; 15 A. 293, 502 ; 20 A. 579 ; 31 A. 67.
§ 149. The plaintiff is not allowed to cumulate several
demands in the same action, when one of them is contrary
to, or precludes another.
As when one has bought a thing in the name of another,
and with his funds, without his authorization, the person for
whom the purchase has been made, can not demand, by the
same action, both the thing bought in his name and the
money employed for paying the price.
Nor can a vendor demand, at the same time, the rescission
of the sale he had made and the price for which it was made;
he must decide for one or the other of the two causes of
action as the one precludes the other.
C. P. 55, 57, 152 ; 9 M. 631 ; 10 M. 601 ; 11 M. 287 ; 1 N. 8.
439 ; 2 N. S. 323 ; 6 N. S. 30, 392 ; 7 N. S 403 ; 8 N. S. 334, 438 ;
1 L 139 ; 4 L. 353, 360 ; 5 L. 440 ; 8 L 267 ; 13 L. 582 ; 14 L. 279;
15 L. 78, 199 ; 16 L 384 ; 6 R. 520 ; 11 R. 87 ; 12 R. 188 ; 2 A. 158 ;
3 A. 36l> ; 7 A. 568 ; 8 A. 49 ; 14 A. 181 ; 15 A. 69, 621 ; 16 A. 287 ;
20 A. 254, 255; C. C. 2275 ^5255). "
§ 150. In possessory actions one can not claim, at the
same time, both the possession and the ownership ; if the
two are demanded, it shall be presumed that the possessory
has been relinquished in order to resort to the petitory
action.
C. P. 54, 55, 57 ; 16 L. 380 ; 15 A. 621.
§ 151. If the plaintiff has several causes of action
tending to the same conclusion, not contrary to, nor ex
clusive of, each other, though they arise from different
contracts, he may cumulate and bring them in the same
suit ; as, for example, if one claim from another one hundred
dollars in virtue of a sale, and one thousand doljars in virtue
of a loan, or if he claim a movable from another both by in
heritance and by purchase.
§ 152. When two causes of actions, contrary to, and
exclusive of each other, have been cumulated in the same de
mand, the defendant may refuse to plead to the merits until
the plaintiff have made his choice as to which of the two he
means to proceed with; and if the exception be sustained
by the court, the plaintiff shall be bound to amend his peti
tion so as to preserve only one cause of action; otherwise
his suit shall be dismissed with costs.
C. P. 54, 55, 56, 57; 6 N. S. 392; 7 N. S. 403; 15 L. 195: 3 A. 365;
13 A. 277; 24 A. 597, 603; 31 A. 67.
§ 153. Demands are principal or incidental.
The principal demand is that by which the suit is com
menced in court; and for this reason it is also termed or
dinary demand.
An incidental demand is that which is made before issue
joined, in order to obtain something relating to the principal
object of the suit; such are demands in warranty or in in
tervention.
17 L. 176; 6 R. 466.
§ 154. The principal demand must be brought before
the court which has the jurisdiction of the case.
The incidental demand must be decided at the same time
with the principal; it is subject to the same jurisdiction as
the suit itself.
C. P. 391; 17 L. 176; 6 R. 466; 29 A. 194.
§ 155. One should only demand in court what is really
due to him; nevertheless, if one demand more, the action
shall be sustained for the amount actually due, and the de
fendant shall pay the costs, unless he prove that, previous to
the suit, he made a real offer of the amount actually due to
the plaintiff, with the interest and costs which had accrued.
24 A.' 50.
§ 156. If one demand less than is due him, and do not
amend his petition in order to augment his demand, he shall
lose the overplus.
C. P. 91; 14 L. 140; 2 R. 207; 14 A. 316; 29 A. 841.
§ 157. If, in an action of debt, the plaintiff fail to claim,
the interest due to him, or to amend his petition in order to
include it, he can not, after j udgment, demand such interest by
another action; he shall be considered as having remitted it.
But, as relates to the costs of the suit, it is not required
that they should have been claimed in the petition or answer,
in order to recover them; they are due to him in favor of
whom the judgment has been rendered, even if nothing is
said on the subject in the judgment.
C. P. 549. 551, 553, 554; 17 L. 331; 1 R. 469; 12 R. 194; 6 A. 297;
20 A. 217; 23 A. 4*3; 33 A. 581.
§ 158. When the demand is premature, that is to say,
■when the action has been brought before the debt had be
come due, the suit must be dismissed, leaving to the party
his right to bring his action in due time.
The same rule must be observed if the object due be de
manded out of the place where it was to have been delivered,
or if the obligation be conditional, and its execution be de
manded before the condition has been fulfilled.
C. C. 205.2 (2047), 2168 (2164); C. P. 244; 1 L. 420, 504; 8 L. 589:
11 L. 420; 13 L. 403; 15 A. 689, 707; 20 A. 538.
§ 159. Judicial demands are either verbal or in writing.
It is only before justices of the peace that demands may
be made verbally, as will be provided in the rules to be ob
served for proceeding before the tribunals of justices of the
peace.
All other demands brought before the courts must be in
writing, and in the form of a petition.
C. P. 169, 170, 1073.
§ 160. Though there be as many kinds of demands as
there are actions, those which must be made in writing are
subject to no distinct and peculiar form ; they are only sub
jected to a few general and common rules hereafter provided.
13 L. 416
§ 161. It is sufficient, in all judicial demands which are
required to be in writing, to express clearly what is demand
ed, with such conclusions as may serve as a basis to the
judgment to be rendered in the cause.
§ 162. It is a general rule in civil matters that one
must be sued before his own judge, that is to say, before the
judge having jurisdiction over the place where he has his
domicile or residence, and shall not be permitted to elect any
other domicile or residence for the purpose of being sued,
but this rule is subject to those exceptions expressly pro
vided for by law.
§ 163. In actions of revendication of real property, or
when proceedings are instituted in order to obtain the seiz
ure and the sale of real property, in virtue of an act of
hypothecation importing confession of judgment, and in ac
tions brought to enforce a legal or judicial mortgage against
a third possessor, and in actions against a third possessor to
enforce a special mortgage, and in all cases of provisional
seizure and sequestration, the defendant may be cited,
whether in the first instance or. in appeal, either within the
jurisdiction where the property revendicated or hypothe
cated, or provisionally seized or sequestered is situated, or
found, though he has his domicile or residence out of that
jurisdiction, or in that where the defendant has his domicile,
as the plaintiff chooses, provided that all judgments rendered
in such cases, shall only be operative up to the value of
the property proceeded against, and not binding for any
excess over the value of the property in personam against
the defendant.
§ 164. In matters relative to successions, the defend
ants, though domiciliated elsewhere, must be cited to appear
before the court of the place where the succession has been
opened :
1. In all suits brought by the heirs against each other,
until after partition inclusively ;
2. In all suits brought by the creditor of the deceased
previous to the partition ;
3. In all suits relating to the execution of testamentary
dispositions until the final settlement of the affairs of the
estate has been effected ;
4. When a partition of a succession has been or may be
made belonging to one or several heirs, who are present or
represented therein, all the real and personal actions, or
others which are relative to said succession, shall be brought
against the said heirs before the court where the said suc
cession is opened.

§ 165. There are other exceptions to this rule which re
quire that the defendant be sued before the judge having
jurisdiction over the place of domicile or residence ; they
are here enumerated :
1. In matters relative to the partition of real property
between several co-proprietors ; for in such a case the suit
must be brought before the court of the place where such
property is situated, though the co-proprietors may reside
in different parishes ;
2. In matters relative to partnership, as long as the part
nership continues, in all suits concerning it, the parties must
be cited to appear before the tribunal of the place where it
is established, or if there are several establishments, before
that of the place where the obligation was entered into ;
3. In matters relative to failure, all the suits already
commenced, or which may be subsequently instituted
against the debtor, must be carried before the court in which
the failure has been declared ;
4. In matters relative to warranty, they must be carried
before the court having cognizance of the principal action
in which demands in warranty arise.
5. When the defendants are foreigners, or have no known
place of residence in the State, they may be cited wherever
they are found ;
6. When the defendants are joint obligors, they may be
cited at the domicile of any one of them ;
7. In suits to enforce the collection of bonds of State and
parish officers, the courts of the parish, in which the officers
exercise the duties of their offices, shall have jurisdiction
over the securities, it matteis not in what parish they may
reside ;
8. In actions of trespass on real estate, and in all matters
relating to real servitudes, be they natural or conventional
the judge of the place where the property is situated shall
have cognizance of the cases ;
9. In all cases where any corporation shall commit tres
pass, or do anything for which an action for damages lies, it
shall be liable to be sued in the parish where such damage
is done or trespass committed.
§ 166. If a defendant reside alternately in different
parishes, he must be cited in that in which he appears to
have his principal establishment, or his habitual residence.
If his residence in each appear to be nearly of the same
nature, in such a case he may be cited In either, at the choice
of the plaintiff, unless he has declared, pursuant to the pro
vision of the law, in which of those parishes he intended to
have his domicile.

claims, and the amount of which he specifies, is really due
to him, and that he verily believes that the defendant
is about to remove from the State permanently, without
leaving in it sufficient property to satisfy his demand ; and
that he does not take this oath with the intention of vexing
the defendant, but only in order to secure his demand.
The creditor, his agent or attorney in fact, praying such
arrest, must besides annex to his petition his obligation in
favor of the clerk for a sum exceeding by one-half the
amount of that which he claims, with the surety of one good

may be taken either by the creditor himself, or, in his
absence, by his attorney in fact or his agent.

payment, in the cases provided in the two preceding articles,

clerk of the court before which he sues, or before the judge
of any other place, provided the signature of such judge be
proved or duly authenticated.
And in all cases, when by any provision of this Code an
oath of a party is required, it may (in case of the absence of
said party) be made by his agent or attorney; and in such
case it shall be sufficient for the agent or attorney to swear
to the best of his knowledge and belief.

the security shall be liable for the debt due the complaining
creditor, in case the debtor shall have departed from the

Of Attachment in the Hands of Third Persons.
§ 239. An attachment in the hands of third persons, is
a mandate which a creditor obtains from a competent judge,
commanding the seizure of any property, credit or right, be
longing to his debtor, in whatever hands they may be found,
to satisfy the demand which he intends to bring against him.
4 N. L. 431; 7 N. S. 525; 3 A. 186; 14 A. 140, 222. 296, 832; 15;
A. 122, 715; 16 A. 137; 22 A. 525; 24 A. 311; D. Sec. 96, 1746;
D. 1936; 29 A. 68; Act, 1880, No. 106, clerks; C. P. 237.
§ 240. A creditor may obtain such attachment of the
property of his debtor, in the following cases:
1. When such a debtor is about leaving permanently the
State without there being a possibility, in the ordinary course
of judicial proceedings, of obtaining or executing judgment
against him previous to his departure, or when such debtor
has already left the State permanently;
2. When such debtor resides out of the State;
3. When he conceals himself to avoid being cited and
forced to answer the suit intended to be brought against him;
4. When he has mortgaged, assigned or disposed of, or is
about to mortgage, assign or dispose of his property, rights
or credits, or some part thereof, with intent to defraud his
creditors or give an unfair preference to some of them;
■ 5. When he has converted, or Is about to convert his prop
erty into money or evidences of debt, with intent to place it
beyond the reach of his creditors.
§ 241. A creditor may, in the like manner, obtain a
mandate of seizure against all species of property belonging
to his debtor, real or personal, whether it consists of credits,
or rights of action, and whether such property be in the
debtor's possession or in that of third persons, by whatever
title the same be held, either as deposit or placed under their
custody.

424; 6 L. 298; 8 L. 137, 176; 9 L. 123, 440.
§ 242. The property of a debtor may be attached in the
hands of third persons by his creditor, in order to secure the
payment of a debt, whatever may be its nature, whether the
amount be liquidated or not, provided the creditor, his agent
or attorney in fact, who prays for the attachment, state ex
pressly and positively the amount which he claims.
§ 243. A creditor wishing to have the property of his
debtor attached, must demand it in a petition presented to a
competent judge, and to obtain the issuance of such attach
ment it shall be sufficient for the creditor to swear to the
existence of the debt demanded by him, and that he verily
believes that the debtor has left the State permanently, or
is on the eve of leaving the State permanently, or that he
resides out of the State, or conceals himself, so that citation
can not be served on him, or that he has mortgaged,
assigned or disposed of, or is about to mortgage, assign
or dispose of his property, rights or credits, or some part
thereof, with intent to defraud his creditors or give an
unfair preference to some of them, or that he has converted
or is about to convert his property into money or evidences
of debt with intent to place it beyond the reach of his cred
itors.
§ 244. In cases where the debt or obligation is not
yet due, such attachment may be granted, on the oath
of the creditor, or of his agent or attorney in fact, if such
creditor be absent ; and it shall be lawful for any judge of
competent jurisdiction to order a writ of attachment to
issue, whenever the said judge shall be satisfied by the oath
of the creditor or.his agent or attorney, of the existence of
said debt, and upon the said creditor, his agent or attorney
in fact, taking oath to the requisites contained in any one of
the numbers one, two, three, four or five of article two>
hundred and forty, or swears that said debtor is about to
remove his property out of the State before said debt be
comes due ; and it shall be sufficient for the oath required
to be taken by the agent or attorney in fact to be to the
best of his knowledge and belief.
§ 245. A creditor, his agent or attorney in fact, praying
such attachment, must, besides, annex to his petition his
obligation in favor ot the clerk for a sum equal to that
which he claims, with the surety of one good and solvent
person residing within the jurisdiction of the court to which
the petition is presented, as a security for the payment of
such damages as such defendant may recover against him
in case it should be decided that the attachment was
wrongfully obtained.

§ 246. If a creditor know or suspect that a third person
has in his possession property belonging to his debtor, or
that he is indebted to such debtor, he may make such a
person a party to the suit, by having him cited to declare on
oath what property belonging to the defendant he has in his
possession or in what sum he is indebted to such defendant,
even when the term of payment has not yet arrived.
The person thus made a party to the suit is termed the
garnishee.
And whenever a party, plaintiff in a cause, has applied
for a writ of fieri facias against the defendant, and has
reason to believe that a third party has property or effects
in his possession, or under his control, belonging to the
defendant, or is indebted to him, he may cause such third
person to be cited to answer under oath, such interrogations
as may be propounded to him touching said property and
effects, or such indebtedness, in the same manner and with
the same regulations as are provided in relation to gar
nishees in cases of attachment. Such third person shall
thereupon be bound to answer in the same manner, and
shall be liable in the same manner for his neglect or refusal
to answer, and his answers may be disproved in the same
manner as those of the garnishee's. In case such third person
shall confess in his answers that he has property or effects
in his possession, or under his control, belonging to the
defendant, or is indebte J to him in any sum of money, the
court shall order him forthwith to deliver up said property,
to pay such sum, (if the same be due, and if not, when the
same shall be due,) to the sheriff, and a copy of said order
with a receipt of the sheriff indorsed thereon, shall be
delivered to the said third person, and, shall be decreed
equivalent to a receipt from the debtor himself.
The property and effects in the possession of a third per
son, belonging to the defendant, or debts due by him to such
defendant, shall be decreed to be levied as by the sheriff,
from the date of the service of the interrogatories on such
persons.
And no seizure shall bind any property, money, or effects,
rights or claims in the hand of a garnishee, either under
process of attachment, or fieri facias, unless service of the
interrogatories has been personal upon such garnishee.
§ 248. If a creditor, who has filed interrogatories on
~ facts and articles to be answered by a garnishee, declare
upon oath that he verily believes that such garnishee has in
hands, property or effects belonging to his debtor, or is in
debted to the defendant in any sum of money, whether the
same be due or not, and that such garnishee is about to de
part from the State without having filed his answers to such
interrogatories, such garnishee may be arrested and confined
until he gives good and sufficient security, in a sum exceed
ing by one-half the amount claimed by the plaintiff, that he
shall appear whenever cited so to do before any judge or
justice of the peace to answer the interrogatories put to him
and that he shall answer them in the manner provided in the
preceding article.
15 A. 379 ; 24 A. 168.
§ 219. The garnishee may, nevertheless, be discharged,
without being obliged to give security, if he prove to the
satisfaction of the court which had given the order of arrest,
after notice in writing having been served on the defendant
of his intention of making such proof, that he has no inten
tion of leaving the State ; or, if he immediately, in the
presence of the court, answer in writing and pertinently the
interrogatories put to him, and file such answer in the office
of the clerk of the court.
15 A. 379.
§ 250. A garnishee may be made party to a suit, and
be cited to answer interrogatories on facts and articles,
either by praying to that effect in the original petition, or by
a supplemental petition filed at any stage of the suit previous
to rendering the judgment.
12 R. 445; 13 A. 549 ; 15 A. 379; 29 A. 194.
§ 251. When an order to attach property in the hands
of a third person has been given by a court, the clerk of such
court shall deliver or send to the sheriff a copy of such order
as well as of the petition, together with a citation to the per
son made party to the suit to answer such petition within
the usual delay granted in ordinary cases.
§ 252. If there be a garnishee made party to the suit,
the clerk must deliver or send to the sheriff a copy of the
petition and of the interrogatories annexed to it, if there be
such, with a summons directed to such' garnishee to answer
the same within the delay given in ordinary suits.
12 E 445 ; 7 A. 238, 538 ; 15 A. 379.
§ 253. The sheriff must serve such citation :
1. On the person of the defendant, or at his domicile if he
has one in the place, or if he be about to leave the State ;
2. At the place where the defendant has resided last, if he
had a domicile in the place, and conceal himself to avoid
being cited.
9 A. 524 ; 13 A. 311 ; 15 A. 379.
§ 254. If, on the contrary, the defendant has no known
place of residence, conceal his person, be absent or reside
out of the State, in such case the sheriff shall serve the at
tachment and citation by affixing copies of the same on the
door of the room where the court in which the suit is pend
ing is held.
§ 255. In the latter case, the sheriff must keep the
copy of the petition, in order to deliver the same to such
party should he appear, or to the advocate appointed to de
fend him in his absence.
21 A. 462 ; 24 A. 512; 32 A. 467.
§ 256. The sheriff, as soon as he shall have served the
copy of the petition, in the manner prescr.bed in the preced
ing articles, and notified the garnishee of the same in the
form required to be observed as relates to garnishees, if
there be such made party to the suit, must seize and detain
so much of whatever property the debtor may possess
within the parish over which his powers extend, whether it
consists of goods, effects, rights, credits, or right of actions,
as may be equal in value to the amount claimed in the suit ;
and he must immediately after deliver or send to the clerk
of the court by which the attachment was granted, his re
turn in writing, stating the manner in which he has executed
the same.
8 N. S. 352 ; 3 R. 232 ; 9 A. 524 ; 14 A. 65, 140, 222 ; 16 A. 105.
§ 257. The sheriff must take charge and keep posses
sion of all the goods and effects which he may have attached,
with the exception of such sums which may be due by the
garnishee, and he shall make, in the presence of two wit
nesses, an exact and minute inventory of the same, which he
shall be bound to deliver or send, annexed to his return, to
the office of the clerk of the court whose mandate he has
executed.
9 A. 361, 524 ; 12 A. 425 ; 15 A. 22, 25 ; 21 A. 7.
§ 258. If the defendant thus made a party to a suit
appear, after having been served with the citation, or prove
in a summary way, after having given due notice in writing
to the adverse party, that the allegations on which the order
for attachment had been obtained were false, such attach
ment shall be dissolved, and the party will be allowed to pro
ceed in his defense as in ordinary suits.
§ 259. The defendant, if he appear either in person or
by his advocate, may, moreover, in every stage of the suit,
have the property attached released by delivering to the
sheriff his obligation for the sum exceeding by one-half the
value of the property attached, with the surety of a good and
solvent person residing within the jurisdiction of the court
where the action was brought, that he will satisfy such judg
merit, to the value of the property attached, as may be ren
dered against him in the suit pending.
When the defendant has given such obligation with secu
rity, the sheriff shall be bound to return the bond so taken
by him into court in the same manner as is provided for bail
bonds; and the plaintiff shall have the same right and same
time to object to the insufficiency of the security on such
bond as to the security on bail bonds ; and in case the secu
rity on said bond should be declared insufficient, the sheriff
shall be liable as surety on the said bond, and the said act
of surety shall be assigned by the sheriff to the plaintiff in
the same manner as bail bonds.
And when the defendant fails to satisfy the judgment ren
dered against him, the plaintiff may, on the return of the
sheriff that no property has been found, and on exhibiting
to the court said obligation duly transferred to him, obtain
judgment against the surety on said obligations, upon mo
tion, after ten days' previous notice to said surety, which
motion shall be tried summarily and without the interven
tion of a jury, unless the said surety shall allege under oath,
that the signature to the bond purporting to be his, is not
genuine, or that judgment has been satisfied.
§ 260. If, on the contrary, the party fail to appear,
either in person or by his attorney, the court shall appoint
an advocate to represent him and defend the suit, and a rea
sonable delay shall be given to such advocate to enable him
to communicate with the party he represents, in order to ob
tain the information necessary to defend the suit.

§ 261. If the property attached and which has been
seized, be of a perishable nature, and subject to be lost or
deteriorated during the pendency of the suit, the court may,
at the request of the plaintiff, order the sale of such prop
erty at public auction, after the usual advertisement, and
after the same has been appraised by two experts appointed
for that purpose, in order that the proceeds of such sale
may remain in deposit in the hands of the sheriff until the
definitive decision of this suit.
9 A. 460.
§ 262. The garnishee who has been cited in a suit, must
put in his answer within the usual delay, declaring in the
same, fairly and truly, what property belonging to the de
fendant he has in his possession, by whatever title he may
possess the same, as well as what sums he may owe to such
defendant, whether the same be due or not yet due, and if
interrogated on facts and articles, he must answer under
oath, clearly and categorically, each question put to him
touching such matter.

§ 263. If the garnishee, to whom interrogatories have
been put, refuse or neglect to answer the same under oath
in the delay of the law, such refusal or neglect shall be con
sidered as a confession of his having in his hands property
belonging to the debtor, sufficient to satisfy the demand
made against such debtor, and judgment shall be rendered
against him for the amount claimed by the defendant, with
interest and costs.
5 L. 86; 8 L. 158, 162, 171, 271 ; 12 L. 17 ; 12 R. 481 ; 2 A. 565 ;

354; 31 A. 546, 865.
§ 264. Although the answer of the garnishee to the
question put to him, be made under oath, the plaintiff may,
nevertheless, show the same to be false, either by positive
written proof, or by the oath of two witnesses worthy of
belief, in the same manner as when interrogatories on facts
and articles have been put to a party in a suit ; and if it be
proved by such evidence that the garnishee has in his hands
property or effects belonging to the party against whose
property the attachment has been granted, or that he be in
debted to him in any amount, such property and effects, as
well as such sum as may be due by him, shall be subject to
satisfy such judgment as may be rendered against the de
fendant.
§ 265. In suits where attachment is demanded after
answer filed, or if the defendant has failed to answer, the
plaintiff must proceed in the ordinary form to obtain judg
ment, and on execution of the same, have so much of the
property attached sold as will suffice to satisfy said judg
ment.

§ 266. If the debtor whose property has been attached
has filed his answer, or has given instruction to the advocate
appointed by the court to defend him, the act of surety given
by the plaintiff shall be cancelled as soon as judgment shall
have been rendered in favor of such plaintiff.
But if the residence of the debtor whose property has
been attached be unknown, and the advocate appointed to
defend him has been unable to communicate with him, the
act of surety so given by the plaintiff shall continue in full
forse one whole year after the date of the judgment given
in favor of the plaintiff, in order to secure the recourse
which the debtor may have, as provided in the following
§cle.
C. P. 614.
§ 267. The absent debtor, against whom judgment has
been so rendered, may, within two years after such judg
ment, obtain the reversal of the same, if he prove that the
distance at which he lived from the place where the attach
ment was obtained, has prevented his being apprised of the
proceedings had against him, and that the plaintiff has
availed himself of his absence to obtain payment of a debt
either already paid in totality, or partly discharged, or which
did not exist.
13 A. 410; 14 A. 73; 18 A. 735; 24 A. 352; C. P. 614.
§ 268. In case such evidence be shown by the party
whose property has been attached, judgment shall be given
against the plaintiff in the first suit, not only for such
amount as he may have recovered above the sum which was
really due to him, but also for such damages as may have
been sustained by the defendant; but as relates to the
§rity, such action, if brought against him, must be insti
tuted within the year following the judgment wrongfully
obtained.

Of Sequestration.
§ 269. Sequestration is a mandate of the court, order
ing the sheriff, in certain cases, to take into his possession
and to keep a thing of which another person has the posses
sion, until after the decision of a suit, in order that it be de
livered to him who shall be adjudged entitled to have the
property or possession of that thing. This is what is prop
erly called a judicial sequestration.
C C. 2979 (2948) ; C. P. 2:57. 724 ; 10 R. 147 ; 14 A. 504 ; 15 A.
618 ; D. Sec. 96, 1746 ; D. 1936. Ex S. 1877, p. 102, No. 62; D. 3534;
28 A. 97; 29 A. 73.'; 30 A. 1246; 31 A. 37.
§ 270. In this acceptation, the word sequestration,
does not mean "judicial" deposit, because sequestration may
exist together with the right of administration, while mere
deposit does not admit it.
§ 271. All species of property, real or personal, as well
as the revenue proceeding from the same," may be seques
tered.
§ 272. Obligations and titles may also be sequestered
when their ownership is in dispute.
§ 273. Judicial sequestration is generally ordered only
at the request of one of the parties to a suit; there are cases,
nevertheless, where it is decreed by the court without such
request, or is the consequence of the execution of judg
ments.
The rules relative to the sequestration in consequence of
the execution of judgment, will be found in the chapter
which treats of the execution of judgments.
§ 274. The court may order, ex officio, the sequestra
tion of real property in suits, where the ownership of such
property is in dispute, and when one of the contending par
ties does not seem to have a more apparent right to the
possession than the other.
In such cases, sequestration may be ordered to continue
until the question of ownership shall have been decided.
C. P. 658; 3 A. 267; D. Sec. 538; Acts 1826, p. 170.
§ 275. Sequestration may be ordered at the request of
one of the parties in a suit, in the following cases:
1. When one, who had possessed for more than one year,
has been evicted through violence, and sues to be restored
to his possession.
2. When one sues for the possession of movable property,
and fears that the party having possession, may send the
property in dispute out of the jurisdiction of the court
during the pendency of the suit.
3. When one claims the ownership or the possession of
real property, and has good ground to apprehend that the
defendant may make use of his possession to dilapidate or
to waste the fruits or revenues produced by such property,
or convert them to his own use.
4. When a woman sues for a separation from bed and
board, or only for a separation of property from her husband,
and has reason to apprehend that he will ruin her dotal
property, or waste the fruits or revenue produced by the
same, during the pendency of the action.
5. When one has petitioned for a stay of proceedings, and
a meeting of his creditors, and such creditors fear that he
may avail himself of such stay of proceedings to place the
whole or a part of his property out of their reach.
6. A creditor, by special mortgage shall have the power of
sequestering the mortgaged property, when he apprehends
that it will be removed out of the State before he can have
the benefit of his mortgage, and will make oath of the facts
which induced his apprehension.
7. The plaintiff may obtain a sequestration in all cases
where he has a lien or privilege on property upon com
plying with the requisites provided by law.
8. A sequestration may be ordered in all cases, when one
party fears that the other will conceal, part with or dispose of
the movable in his possession, during the pendency of the
suit, upon complying with the requisites of the law.
§ 276. A plaintiff wishing to obtain an order of seques
tration in any one of the cases above provided, must annex
to the petition in which he prays for such an order, an affi
davit setting forth the cause for which he claims such order;
he must besides, execute his obligation in favor of the clerk
for such sum as the court shall determine, with the surety
of one good and solvent person residing within the jurisdic
tion of the court, to be responsible for such damages as the
defendant may sustain in case such sequestration should
have been wrongfully obtained.
§ 277. When security is given in order to obtain the
sequestration of real property which brings a revenue, the
judge must require that it be given for an amount sufficient
to compensate the defendant, not only for all damage which
he may sustain, but also for the privation of such revenue
during the pandency of the action.

§ 278. The plaintiff, when he prays for a sequestration
of the property of one who has failed, is not required to
give such security, though that property bring in a revenue.
§ 279. A defendant against whom a mandate of se
questration has been obtained, except in cases of failure,
may have the same set aside by executing his obligation in
favor of the sheriff, with one good and solvent surety, for
whatever amount the judge may determine, as being equal
to the value of the property to be left in his possession.
And whenever the defendant shall fail or neglect to execute
such obligation in the manner prescribed, within ten days
after the seizure of the property by the sheriff, then it shall
be lawful for the plaintiff, his agent or attorney in fact, to
give similar bond and security to the sheriff as that required
by law from the defendant, and to take the property seques
tered into his possession.
And in all cases where the property sequestered shall be
released on the defendant executing a bond with security,
the sheriff shall be bound to return the bond so taken by
him into court in the same manner as is required for bail
bonds; and the plaintiff shall have the same right and the
same time to object to the insufficiency of the security on
such bond as to the security on bail bonds; and in case the
§rity on said bond should be declared insufficient, the
sheriff shall be liable as surety on said bond, and the said
act of surety shall be assigned by the sheriff to the plaintiff
in the same manner as bail bonds.
§ 280. The security thus given by the defendant, when
the property sequestered consists in movables, shall be re
sponsible that he shall not send away the same out of the
jurisdiction of the court; that he shall not make an improper
use of them; and that he will faithfully present them, after
definitive judgment, in case he should be decreed to restore
the same to the plaintiff.
§ 281. As regards landed property this security is given
to prevent the defendant, while in possession from wasting
the property, and for the faithful restitution of the fruits
that he may have received since the demand, or of their
value in the event of his being cast in the suit.

suant to an order of the court, he shall, after serving the
petition and the copy of the order of sequestration on the
defendant, send his return in writing to the clerk of the court
which gave the order, stating in the same in what manner
the order was executed, and annex to such return a true and
minute inventory of the property sequestrated, drawn by
him in the presence of two witnesses.
4 N. S. .242.
§ 283. The sheriff, while he retains possession of se
questered property, is bound to take proper care of the
same, and to administer the same, if it be of such nature as
to admit of it, as a prudent father of a family administers
his own affairs. He may confide them to the care of guard
ians or overseers, for whose acts he remains responsible, and
he will be entitled to receive a just compensation for his
administration, to be determined by the court, to be paid to
him out of the proceeds of the property sequestered, if judg
ment be given in favor of the plaintiff.

Of the Appearance and Answer of the Defendant.
§ 316. When the defendant appears, he may pray for
further time to answer, and the court may grant a further
delay, if necessary for the purposes of justice.
8 N. S. 505, 514 ; 4 L 564 ; 7 L. 393 ; 20 A. 281.
§ 317. It shall be sufficient in all cases, except in the
first judicial district, for a defendant to file his answer on the
first day of the term.
§ 318. In the delay given to the defendant for answer
ing, Sunday is included like other days ; but in all cases
where delay is given either to do something or to answer,

§ 319. The answer must express the name, surname
and residence of the defendant, as well as the name of the
plaintiff ; and it must be free from all abusive, defamatory,
or impertinent expressions.
It must conclude by praying that the demand of the
plaintiff be rejected, and that he be sentenced to pay the
costs of the suit ; unless the defendant himself should in
cidentally plead compensation or some other exception.
§ 320. The defendant may refuse to answer to the
merits if he has good ground for such refusal, as if the suit
is brought by one pretending to act as the attorney in fact
of the plaintiff, and he fail to annex to the petition a copy of
his power of attorney, or by a minor without being assisted
by his tutor, or by a married woman without the authoriza
tion of her husband or of the court.
§ 321. In all the cases mentioned in the preceding arti
cles, and in all other. cases of the like nature, if the defend
ant take any such exceptions, and the same be sustained by
the court, he shall not be required to answer to the merits
until the documents which he calls for be produced, or until
the plaintiff be assisted in such a manner as to enable them
to proceed regularly.

§ 323. When the defendant answers to the merits, he is
not bound to answer specially to all the allegations con
tained in the petition; it is sufficient to deny, generally, all
the facts stated, except he be called upon either to acknowl
edge or to deny his signature.

§ 324. When the demand is founded on an allegation,
or an act under private signature, which is alleged to have
been signed by the defendant, such defendant shall be bound
in his answer to acknowledge expressly or to deny his
signature.
§ 325. If the defendant deny his signature in his answer,
or contend that the same has been counterfeited, the plain
tiff must prove the genuineness of such signature, either by
witnesses who have seen the defendant sign the act, or who
declare that they know it to be his signature, because they
have frequently seen him write and sign his name.
But the proof by witnesses shall not exclude the proof by
experts or by a comparison of the writing, as established by
the Civil Code.

incidental demand, when the same grows out of the action
or is specially permitted by law.

§ION VII.
Of Exceptions and Defence.
§ 330. Exceptions are means of defence used by the
defendant to retard, prevent or defeat the demand brought
against him.
But the word defence, in its more restricted acceptation,
is only applied to such exceptions as go to the merits, show
ing that the action is neither just nor well founded.
C. C. 1882 (1876.)
§ 331. There are two principal species of exceptions ;
some are dilatory, others peremptory.
Dilatory exceptions are divided into declinatory and those
simply called dilatory exceptions.
§ 332. Dilatory exceptions are such as do not tend to
defeat the action, but only to retard its progress ; declinatory
exceptions have this effect, as well as the exception of dis
cussion opposed by a third possessor or by a surety in an
hypothecary action, or the exception taken in order to call in
the warrantor.
C. C. 1882 (1876); 3 L. 308; 3 R. 57; 5 R. 268; 14 A. 185, 456 ;
24 A. 472.
§ 333. It is a rule which governs in all cases of excep
tions, except in such as relate to the absolute incompetency
of the judge before whom the suit is brought, that they
must be pleaded spec.ally in limine litis, before issue joined,
otherwise they shall not be admitted.
Hereafter no dilatory exceptions shall be allowed in any
case after a judgment by default has been taken, and in
every case they must be pleaded in limine litis ; nor shall
such exceptions hereafter be allowed in any answer in any
cause.
§ 334. Declinatory exceptions do not tend to defeat
the demand, but only to decline the jurisdiction of the judge
before whom it is brought.
In uch cases, the defendant contends that he is not
boun to plead before the court in which the action has
been brought.
C. C. 1882 (1876); 12 L. 118.
§ 335. There are two kinds of declinatory exceptions :
1. When the exception is taken to the competency of the
judge, pursuant to the rules above provided ;
2. When it arises from the fact of another suit being
pending between the same parties for the same object, and
growing out of the same cause of action, before another
court of concurrent jurisdiction.
In both cases the suit must be dismissed, and the plain
tiff decreed to pay costs.

803; 24 A. 513.
§ 336. Declinatory exceptions may be pleaded in the
defendant's answer, previous to his answering to the merits;
but, except as relate to the declinatory exceptions, the de
fendant must plead in his answer all dilatory or peremptory
exceptions on which he intends to rely, or which he is bound
to plead expressly and specially, pursuant to the provisions
of this Code.

} III.
Of the Recusation of Judges.
§ 337. Recusation is the refusal on the part of the de
fendant to have his cause tried by the judge before whom
he has been sued, on account of the ties of relationship ex
isting between such judge and the plaintiff, or for other just
causes hereafter expressed.
12 L. 118; 4 R. 23; 2 A 628; 19 A. 382; 21 A. 607; D. Sec. 1067,

335, 385; 27 A 225.
§ 338. The causes for which a judge may be recused
are:
1. His being interested in the cause ; provided, that in all
civil and criminal causes in which the State, the parishes, or
political or religious corporations are interested, it shall not
be sufficient cause to challenge the judge or justice of the
peace, who may have cognizance of the case, (nor the sheriff
or the executive officer, or any of the jurors who are called
to serve In the cause,) to allege that they are citizens or in
habitants of the State or of the parishes, or members of the
said political or religious corporations, or that they pay any
State, parish or city tax ;
2. His being related to one of the parties within the fourth
degree ;
3. His having been employed or consulted as advocate in
the cause.
§ 339. Affinity is not a good cause of recusation, except
when the judge is the father-in-law, son-in-law, or brother-
in-law of one of the parties.
Act 1880, No. 39, $ 1.
§ 340. The judge may recuse himself, but only in such
cases where the parties themselves would have the right of
recusing him.
§ 341. The decision of cases where the judge is recused,
ia provided for in the following article, pursuant to the con
stitution.
Am'd.
§ 342. In any case when the judge may be recused,
and when he is not personally interested in the matters in
contestation, he shall select a lawyer having the qualifica
tions required for a judge of his court, to try such cases.
And when the judge is personally interested in the suit,
he shall call upon the parish or district judge, as the case
may be, to try the case.
§ 343. Peremptory exceptions are those which tend to
the dismissal of the action.
Some relate to forms, others arise from the law.
C. C. 1882 (1876J; 8 N. S. 410, 453; 7 L. 204; 413, 437; 10 L. 169;
10 A. 36; 15 A. 38, 519; 21 A. 50o, 501, 516; 24 A. 273.
§ 344. Peremptory exceptions relating to forms, are
those which tend to have the cause dismissed, owing to some
nullities in the proceedings.
Such exceptions must be pleaded in limine litis, that is to
say, at the beginning of the suit, and before answering to the
merits.
After the defendant has pleaded to the merits, such excep
tions shall not be heard ; all nullities are cured.
C. P. 333 ; 4 R. 472 ; 11 R. 87 ; 1 A. 372 ; 14 A. 390, 586; 30
A. 580.
§ 315. Peremptory exceptions founded on law are those
which without going into the merits of the cause, show that
the plaintiff can not maintain his action, either because it is
prescribed, or because the cause of action has been destroyed
.or extinguished.

§ 346. Peremptory exceptions founded on law may be
pleaded in every stage of the action previous to the definitive
judgment ; but they must be pleaded specially, and sufficient
time allowed to the adverse party to bring his evidence.

§ION VIII.
Of Interrogatories on Facts and Articles.
§ 347. Both plaintiff and defendant are permitted to
annex, either to their petition or their answer, interrogatories
on facts and articles.
§ 348. Interrogatories on facts and articles are ques
tions put in writing, in the form of articles, and annexed to a
petition or to an answer, to which one of the parties to the
suit prays that the other be ordered to respond under oath,
in order to make use of his answers as testimony in support
of his demand, or to aid him in his defense.

276 ; IR. 299 ; 3 R. 243 ; 9 R. 19 ; 14 A. 396, 668 ; 18 A. 717.
§ 349. The party interrogated on facts and articles is
bound to answer, on oath and categorically, each of the
questions put to him, unless he can not do so without con
fessing himself guilty of some crime.
Except in the above case, if the party interrogated refuse
or neglect to answer on oath to all the questions put to him,
the facts concerning which he shall have so refused or neg
lected to answer shall be taken for confessed : Provided no
court shall make an order requiring a female to answer in
terrogatories on facts and articles, in open court, unless the
party propounding them, or his or her agent or attorney,
shall make oath to the materiality of the interrogatories,
and that they are not propounded for the purpose or in the
hope of having them taken for confessed, but with the bona
fide desire to have them truly answered by the party inter
rogated.
§ 350. To enable the defendant to obtain the answer of
the plaintiff to interrogatories, he shall subjoin to the inter
rogatories proposed to be answered, his affidavit of their
materiality, and that in his opinion, the answer of the plain
tiff would assist him in making his defence, but the party in
terrogated may object in writing to any of the questions as
not pertinent, and the judge shall decide summarily whether
he ought to answer or not; if ordered to answer he must do
it, otherwise the facts unanswered will be deemed confessed.
7 N. S. 269; 9 R. 125; 1 A. 247; 2 A. 938; 21 A.680.
§ 351. The party propounding the interrogatories may
require the party interrogated to answer in open court, and

judge, if the party interrogated reside in the parish where
the court holds its sittings.

97, 825 ; 15 A. 240, 612 ; 21. A. 680.
§ 352. In all cases where a party interrogated resides
out ot the parish where the suit is pending, and whether
within or without the State, it shall be his duty to file his
answer to the'interrogatories propounded to him within such
period as shall be fixed by the court, on the motion of the
party interrogating, and notice of which order, fixing the
delay, together with a copy of the interrogatories propound
ed, shall be served on the attorney representing the party
interrogated ; provided, that when the party interrogated
resides out of the State, his answers shall be taken by com
mission.
§ 353. In answering a question, the party must simply
confess or deny the fact.
Nevertheless, the party 'interrogated may state some other
facts tending to his defence, provided they be closely linked
to the fact on which he has been questioned and an appeal
made to his conscience. His declaration, in such a case, shall
have as much effect as his answer to the question itself.

§ION IX.
Of Issue Joined (Contestatio Litis).
§ 357. The cause is at issue when the defendant hae
answered, either by confessing or denying the facts set forth
in the petition, or by pleading such dilatory or peremptory
exceptions as he is bound to plead in limine litis, pursuant
to the provisions of this Code.
5 N. S. 38 ; 8 N. S. 339; 10 A. 247; 14 A. 825, 849; 17 A. 176: 29
A. 398, 557.
§ 358. When the defendant pleads some declinatory
exception, without answering to the merits, there is no issue
joined.
14 A. 825.
§ 359. The joining of issue is in fact the foundation of
the suit, as citation is that of the action ; it is only after this
done that the suit begins ; the parties are then in a situ
ation to discover what evidence Is necessary in support of
their respective claims.
5 N. S. 427; 6 N. S. 469 ; 7 N. S. 285 ; 4 R. 1; 13 A. 63; 14 A. 725
825; 30 A. 139.
§ 360. When the defendant suffers judgment by de
fault to betaken against him, the issue is joined tacitly;
because such defendant is presumed by his silence to have
confessed the justice of his adversary's demand ; therefore
the plaintiff is allowed to proceed with his proofs, in order
to have the judgment confirmed.

§ 361. If after issue joined either the plaintiff or
defendant die, it is not necessary to recommence the action ;
continues between the surviving party and the heirs of
the one deceased, pursuant to the provisions enacted in the
first part of this Code.

CHAPTER III.
OF THE INCIDENTAL DEMANDS WHICH MAY BE MADE PENDING
THE ACTION.
§ 362. The defendant, besides the exceptions which he
can oppose to the action brought against him, may, on his
part, institute demands incidental to the suit, either against
the plaintiff, or against third persons not parties to the cause.
C. P. 101 ; 14 A. 860.
§ 363. The incidental demands which the defendant
may bring are demands :
In compensation ;
In reconvention ;
In warranty.
§ 364. Third persons, not originally party to the suit,
may intervene in the same, and, like the defendant, institute
demands incidental to the main action, either before judg
ment or on exception ; and these demands are called the
intervention and opposition of third persons.
C. P. 389; 11 R. 314;
§ 365. The incidental demands must be made in writing
in the same manner that the principal demand is made.

§ION I.
Of Demands in Compensation, or Set-off.
§ 366. Compensation, or set.off, is a mode of extin
guishing debts, which takes place when it happens that
both plaintiff and defendant are indebted to each other ;
each retaining, in payment of the sum due to him, the
amount which he owes to the other.

§ 367. The defendant may plead compensation, or set
off, at every stage of the proceedings, provided it be pleaded
specially.

617 ; 4 A. 140.
§ 368. Compensation may be pleaded, either in the
answer to the principal demand, or it may be claimed by a
distinct and separate demand.
§ 369. When the debt which the defendant offers in
compensation of that which the plaintiff claims, is of a less
amount than the one demanded, compensation only takes
place for that amount, and judgment must be given in favor
of the plaintiff for the surplus; the defendant must pay the
costs, unless he shows that he has made a real tender of such
oveiplus, at the time and in the manner provided by law.
C. C. 2204 (2200) ; C. P. 415 ; 10 L. 402 ; 16 A. 181.
§ 370. If, on the contrary, the two debts, as to the capi
tal and interest, be equal, the judgment shall free both from
their respective obligations, and direct the costs incurred
pri or to the pleading of compensation to be paid by the de
fendant, and those incurred subsequently to be borne by the
plaintiff.
C. C.2203 (2204); 17 A. 248.
§ 371. But if the debt which the defendant sets-off in
compensation exceed in amount that which the plaintiff
claims, he may pray, in his answer, that the judgment be
given in his favor for the balance ; and if the compensation
be just and equitable, the judgment shall be so rendered.
C. C. 2208 (2204); 17 A. 248. Acts 1821, p. 119.
§ 372. When the defendant opposes compensation, not
in his answer, but by instituting a separate demand before
the same court in which the suit is pending, the plaintiff
shall be bound to answer in the cause, although he may
have his domicile out of the jurisdiction of such court ; pro
vided the compensation so opposed be not of such nature or
amount as to render such court incompetent.
C. P. 162 ; 13 A. 249.
§ 373. If the defendant suffer judgment in the original
suit, without pleading such compensation as he may have to
oppose, as provided above, he shall not, on that account,
lose his right of action against the plaintiff to recover what
ever amount such plaintiff owes to him; but he must bring
his action before the court within whose jurisdiction the
plaintiff has his domicile.

§ION II.
Of Demands in Reconvention.
§ 374. The demand which the defendant institutes in
consequence of that which the plaintiff has brought against
him, is termed a demand in reconvention.

21 A. 185, 303; 32 A. 340.
§ 375. In order to entitle the defendant to institute a
demand in reconvention, it is requisite that such demand,
though different from the main action, be, nevertheless, neces
sarily connected with, and incidental to the same; as, for in
stance, the demand instituted by the possessor in good faith
against him who sues in order to evict him, or for the pur
pose of obtaining the payment of the improvements made on
the premises :
Provided, that when the plaintiff resides out of the State
or in the State, but in a different parish from the defendant
said defendant may institute a demand in reconvention
against him for any cause, although such demand be not
necessarily connected with, or incidental to the main cause
of action.
§ 376. If the demand instituted by the defendant be
one in its nature independent from the action brought by the
plaintiff, it shall be considered as a principal, not a recon
ventional demand, and must be brought at the domicile of
the plaintiff.
§ 377. In all cases of reconvention, the defendant may
plead it either as an exception in his answer to the principal
demand, or institute a distinct and separate demand before
the court in which the main action is pending; and the original
plaintiff shall be bound to answer without pleading to the ju
risdiction of the court, even if he has his domicile elsewhere,
provided the court be competent.

§ION III.
Of Demands in Warranty.
§ 378. The obligation which one contracts to defend
another in some action which may be instituted against him
is termed warranty. The one who has contracted this obli
gation is called the warrantor.

254, 828; 6 A. 32; 7 A. 590; 12 A. 569.
§ 379. Warranty may be of two kinds, real or personal.
Real warranty is that which arises in real or hypothecary
actions ; as when a purchaser is sued in eviction of an im
movable property which has been sold to him.
Personal warranty is that which takes place in personal
actions ; it arises from the obligation which one has con
tracted to pay the whole or a part of a debt due by another
to a third person.
8 R. 27 ; 7 A. 590 ; 8 A. 136 ; 12 A. 660 ; 14 A. 539 ; 19 A. 67, 83.
§ 380. When one is sued in eviction of an immovable
property sold to him, or for the payment of a debt which
another person had promised to pay on his account to the
plaintiff, he shall he entitled to a delay, in order to have his
warrantor made a party to the suit, as provided in the fol
lowing article.
§381. The delay granted to call the warrantor must be
the same as that given to such warrantor to answer to the
demand instituted against him, according to the distance of
his domicile from the place where the court is held in which
the main action is pending.
C. P. 180; 14 L. 497; 19 L. 473; 1 R. 133; 19 A. 67.
§ 382. The defendant wishing to call one in warranty,
may, in his answer, pray the court to decree against his war
rantor the same judgment which may be rendered against
him on the principal action. Such prayer will be considered
as a demand in warranty.
28 A. 297.
§ 383. The clerk of the court in which the defendant
has, in his answer, called one in warranty, must make out a
copy of such answer, and issue a citation, both of which shall
be served on the warrantor, who shall be allowed for answer
ing the same delay as in ordinary suits ; and he shall address
the same to the sheriff of the parish in which the warrantor
resides, in order that it be served on him in the same man
ner as is directed in ordinary suits.
§ 384. The warrantor thus cited is bound to appear
before the court in which the principal demand has been
instituted, even when he resides out of its jurisdiction, in
order to defend the suit for the defendant ; he may plead
every exception in defending the cause which the defendant
himself might have pleaded, even such as are personal to
such defendant.
C. P. 162, 373 ; 4N. 393; 8 N. S. 156 ; 1 L. 38 ; 6 L. 350, 378;
8 L. 239, 252 ; 10 L. 271 ; 14 A. 382.
§ 385. If the defendant is cast in the action, the judge,
when he gives judgment against such defendant, must
render at the same time a judgment in favor of the defend
ant against his warrantor, for whatever indemnity may be
due to such defendant, as well as for all the loss and damage
he may have sustained by reason of the action.
But no sheriff, constable, or other officer of court, shall
have the right to recover of any seizing creditor, sued as
warrantor, the counsel fees of such sheriff, constable or other
officer, incurred by calling such creditor in warranty, unless
the latter shall, within ten days only from service of the call
in warrant y, fail to appear and make defense for the defend
ant who calls him.
§ 386. The judgment so rendered shall be executory on
the part of the plaintiff against the defendant, and on the
part of the defendant against his warrantor.
8 R. 488; 20 A. 568.
§ 187. If one called In warranty has himself a warrantor
who is bound to defend him, he may also in his answer pray
that his warrantor be cited to appear to the suit ; he shall be
entitled, in order to do so, to the same delay granted to the
defendant for calling his warrantor ; the same rules shall
govern, if there be a greater number of warrantors. In such
cases the proceedings shall be carried on, and the judgment
rendered and executed in the manner provided in the pre
ceding articles.
§ 388. The defendant, though he has not called his
warrantor to defend the suit brought against him, does not
lose on that account his action in warranty, unless the war
rantor prove that he had means for defeating the action,
which were not used, owing to the defendant having failed
to call him in warranty, or having neglected to apprise him
of the suit having been brought.

§ION IV.
Of Intervention or Interpleading.
§ 389. An intervention or interpleader, Is a demand by
which a third person requires to be permitted to become a
party in a suit between other persons; by joining the plain
tiff in claiming the same thing, or something connected with
it, or by uniting with the de1endant in resisting the claims of
the plaintiff, or, where his interest requires it, by opposing
both.
§ 390. In order to be entitled to intervene, it is enough
to have an interest in the success of either of the parties in
the suit, or an interest opposed to both.
§ 391. One may intervene either before or after issue
has been joined in the cause, provided the intervention do
not retard the principal suit: the person intervening must be
always ready to plead or to exhibit his testimony, because he
has always his remedy by a separate action to vindicate his
rights.

A. 145; 32 A. 207, 765,
§ 392. The plaintiff in intervention must institute his
demand before the court in which the principal action has
been brought; being considered as plaintiff, he must follow
the jurisdiction of the defendant.
6 N. S. 658; 19 L. 154; 14 A. 427; 19 A. 118; 20 A. 174, 175, 259
21 A. 643; 30 A. 753.
§ 393. The intervention must be formed by a petition
addressed to the court before which the principal demand
has been brought; it must set forth the grounds on which
the cause is supported.
This petition must be served on the party against whom
it is directed, in order that he may answer to the same in
the delay given in ordinary suits.
§ 394. The judge can not refuse to admit an interven
tion ; but he must pronounce on its merits at the same time
that he decides the principal action ; if the demand be not
sustained, the person intervening shall be decreed to pay
the incidental costs.

§ION V.
Of the Opposition of Third Persons.
§ 395. This opposition is a demand brought by a third
person not originally a party in the suit, for the purpose of
arresting the execution of an order of seizure or judgment
rendered in such suit, or to regulate the effect of such seiz
ure in what relates to him.
C. P. 298; 8N. S. 662 ; 3 L. 495 ; 6 L 40 >; 7 L. 486; 4 R.

A. 275 ; Act 1880, No. 109.
§ 396. Such opposition may take place in two cases:
1. When the third person making the opposition pretends
to be the owner of a thing which has been seized;
2. When he contends that he has a privilege on the pro
ceeds of the thing seized and sold.
1 R. 42; 5 R 496; 10 R. 28; 11 R. 181; 8 A. 117; 12 A. 341, 460;

§ 397. This opposition must be made before the court
which has granted the order of seizure or the judgment in
virtue of which the provisional seizure has been effected.

§ 495; 21 A. 196.
§ 398. If the opposition has for its object to set aside
the order of seizure, as having been effected on property not
belonging to the party against whom the order was directed
but owned on the contrary by the third person making the
opposition, it must be done by means of a petition, which,
together with a citation, must be served on the party making
the seizure, as in ordinary suits ; but such opposition shall
be considered as a separate demand, distinct from the suit
in which the order was granted.

30 A 1294; 32 A. 356.
§ 399. The court may, nevertheless, at the request of
the third opponent, enjoin the sheriff not to proceed to the
sale of the property thus claimed ; provided, such third per
son give security to the plaintiff for such an amount as the
court shall determine, to be responsible for all damages
which said plaintiff may sustain, should the opposition be
wrongfully made.

§ 400. If the third person, who has intervened in the
suit, has not enjoined the sale of the property of which he
claims the ownership, or has failed to furnish the surety
required, his opposition shall not prevent the sheriff from
selling the property under seizure ; but in such case the
sheriff shall be personally responsible for all damages which
said sale may occasion to the intervening party, and the
sheriff shall have his recourse against the party who has
obtained the order of seizure. If the opposition be sus
tained, the sale made by the sheriff shall be null ; provided,
that in all such cases, the sheriff may require of the plaintiff
an indemnity bond, with sufficient securities, as provided by
special laws.
§ 401. If, on the contrary, the opposition be made on
the ground that the third opponent has a privilege which
entitles him to be paid in preference to the party making
the seizure out of the proceeds of the sale of the property
seized, as when there are several seizures or conflicting
claims; on the same property; such opposition may be made
by motion, of which due notice must be given both to the
party who has made the seizure and to the sheriff; and the
court, without requiring any security from the third oppo
nent, shall direct the sheriff to retain in his hands, subject
to their further order, trie proceeds of the sale.

a higher class than that of the party who has made the seiz
ure, or a special hypothecation duly registered anterior to
that of such party; in such case, the third opponent shall
be paid for the amount of his claim, together with the in
terest and costs; and the plaintiff in the cause shall be
entitled only to receive the surplus, if there be any.

has only a general or legal hypothecation on the property
seized, the plaintiff in the original suit shall be paid in
preference, if he prove that the defendant has other prop
erty of sufficient value to satisfy the claim of the third op
ponent; in such case, the third person intervening shall be
condemned to pay the costs.

CHAPTEE IV.
OF THE PROCEEDINGS AFTER ISSUE JOINED UNTIL JUDGMENT BE
GIVEN.
§ION I.
Of Real Tender. .
§ 404 When the defendant confesses that he owes the
whole or a part either of the debt or of the property de
manded of him, and the plaintiff refuses to receive what
such defendant acknowledges that he owes him, such defend
ant may make a real tender of the same to such plaintiff,
either after the issue has been joined or even previous to
any judicial proceeding having been instituted against him.

§ 405. It is necessary to distinguish such real tenders
which are made for a debt for money due, from those which
have for their object the obligation of delivering a thing cer

may take testimony of witnesses out of court who reside in
the parish where the cause is pending, on complying with
the laws providing the manner of so doing.

.commissions for taking testimony are directed, shall cause
such witnesses to be summoned to appear before him, for

nexed to the commission, or to the questions put to them by

cases where it is not necessary that such questions be put
in writing.
§ 433. After the depositions have been taken as above
directed, the judge or justice of the peace before whom
they have been taken must cause the same to be signed by
the witness, or in case such witness can not sign, have his
mark affixed to the same in his presence. He shall then
draw a verbal process of the taking of such deposition,
annex the same to tbe commission and interrogatories, if
there be any ; the whole must be enclosed, sealed, and
directed to the clerk of the court.
§ 434. The party on whose application such depositions
have been taken must, before he can use the same as evi
dence in the cause, show that the adverse party has been
served with a written notice of the time and place designated
for taking such depositions, as well as with a copy of the in
terrogatories intended to be put to the witnesses, in all cases
where such notice is required, pursuant to the provisions
above enacted.

§ 435. But such proof shall not be required, if the judge
or justice, by whom the depositions have been taken, certify
that he himself notified the adverse party of the time and
place fixed for taking such depositions before him.
§ 436. "When the witness, intended to be examined,
lives out of the State, it shall be sufficient for the party,
wishing to take his testimony, to apply for the same to any
judge having jurisdiction of the cause, and swear to the
materiality of the testimony.
§ 437. Commissions to examine witnesses out of the
State may be directed to any judge, justice of the peace,
magistrate, or other person residing at the place where such
witnesses live, or to any commissioner appointed by the Gov
ernor of the State.
§ 438. Such commissions must be accompanied with
the interrogatories, after the same have been duly commu
nicated or notified to the adverse party, or his advocate.
If the adverse party reside at the place where the deposi
tions are to be taken, such party must be notified of the
same, in the manner provided relative to taking the deposi
tions of witnesses residing in the State.
C. P. 428 ; 24 A. 589.
§ 439. In all cases where the courts grant commissions
for taking testimony either out of the State or in another
parish, they must fix a term for returning the same. In doing
this, they must take into consideration the distance and
the existing mode of communication ; provided, that com
missions to take testimony may issue at any time after the
service of petition and citation ; and whenever a commis
sion to take testimony shall have been returned, the party
intending to use the depositions, taken under the same, may,
on filing the same in the clerk's office, file a notice or take
a rule, which must be served on the opposite party or his
counsel, to show cause why the same should not be used as
evidence in the case ; whereupon the party, on whom the
rule is taken, shall be bound to urge any objections, if any
he have, to the admission in evidence of said depositions
founded on any irregularity in the execution of said com
mission, and if he fail so to do before the cause is called up
to trial on its merits, all such objections shall be considered
as waived ; provided, that no objections to the deposition,
except such as are founded on irregularity in executing the
commission, shall be' decided on in such rule.
§ 440. If one state under oath, in a petition, to a com
petent court, that he has reason to apprehend that a person
named in said petition, intends to institute a suit against him,
for a cause of action therein set forth; and that he fears that,
previous to the institution of such suit, a witness, whose
evidence is necessary to his defence, may die or depart; in
such case, the court may direct the testimony of such wit
ness to be taken either before them or before any judge or
justice of the peace whom they may appoint for that pur
pose, after written notice having been duly served on the
adverse party, or, if absent, by posting it up in the clerk's
office, and the testimony so taken shall be evidence on the
trial, should the witness examined be dead or absent.

must draw their report, or award, as the ease may be, and
direct the same to the clerk of the court who nominated
them, in order that either of the parties may have the same

§ 454. Such reports or awards, must be signed by the
experts, auditors, or arbitrators named; and if anyone of

foot of the report or award.
C. C. 31.23 (3090).

§ 460. But if, from the submission entered into by the
parties, it appears that they intended to give to the arbitra

in order that it be called in its turn, and a day fixed for its
trial in the manner prescribed by special laws, and the rules
of the respective courts.
§ 464. When a cause is called, the party, who has not
been able to procure the necessary evidence, shall be entitled
to a continuance, on proving either that he has not sufficient
time to get his proof, or has been prevented from doing so
by some unforeseen cause.

§ 465. Even on the day fixed for the trial of the suit, a
party may obtain a continuance, if one of the witnesses sum
moned in the cause, has gone away, and the party applying
for continuance swear that he did not know that such wit
ness intended to depart, or could not prevent his departure,
and that his testimony is material for establishing his claim,
or for supporting his defense.

§ 466. When one of the parties to a suit prays for con
tlnuance, on account of the absence of one, or several of his
witnesses, the adverse party may require hitn to disclose, on
oath, what facts he intends to prove by such witnesses ; and
if such party admit those facts, or if he merely admit, that
the witness would, if present, swear to such facts, the court
shall proceed to the trial, as if such witness had been ex
amined ; provided, that whenever any attorney at law shall
be employed in the service of the State, as a member of the
General Assembly, his absence from court, unless it be the
Supreme Court, during the session of the General Assembly,
shall constitute a peremptory cause for the continuance of
any case wherein he is employed as a leading counsel.
§ 467. The sickness of one of the witnesses summoned
in the cause, is not a sufficient cause of continuance, if such
witness live at the place, and is in a situation to answer in
terrogatories; in such case the party insisting for trial may
require that his deposition be taken by a justice of the
peace, in the presence of the adverse party, or of his advo
cate; or after having 'notified him, or his advocate, to attend
at the examination.

applying for it, appears sufficient to justify the same.

third person, not a party to the suit, has in his possession,
any act, paper documents or books, material to the cause,
which one of the parties wishes to have brought into court.
But in such cases, the order of court requiring the produc
tion of such papers, books or documents, must be served on

shall a person be compelled to produce papers that would
subject him to a criminal prosecution under the penal laws

§ 116.
§ 494. The plaintiff who wishes for a jury must pray
for the same, either in his original petition, or by a supple
mental petition, which must be presented before the suit be
set for trial; provided, that all suits against makers and
indorsers of promissory notes, drawers, indorsers and accept
ors of bills of exchange, and generally all suits brought on
unconditional obligations to pay a specific sum of money,
shall be tried without a jury, unless the defendant shall
make oath that his signature to said note, or other obliga
tion, is not genuine, or that he expects to prove that the
same had been obtained through fraud or error, or want or
failure of consideration, or in cases where the defendant in
his answer may set up a plea of compensation or reconven
tion, and make oath to the truth of all the allegations in said
plea or answer.
§ 495. The defendant, in order to avail himself of the
same privilege, must pray for a jury in his answer, or pre
vious to the suit being set down for trial.

merits, he may, if the plea be overruled, pray for a jury in
his answer to the merits.

§ 496. When a cause is to be tried by a jury, the name
of each of the jurymen summoned to try it, shall be written
separately on tickets, which shall be put in a box destined
for this purpose, from which they shall be drawn by the clerk
in the manner prescribed in the following article:
11 A. 79; D. Sec. 562. Acts 1826, p. 46, $ 5.
§ 497. As soon as any number of jurymen shall be pres
ent, the court shall order the cause to be called, and the clerk
shall draw out of the box, one by one, the tickets on which
the names of the jurymen have been written, and then he
shall form a list of them in the order in which they shall have
been drawn.
§ 498. The formality of drawing the names of jury
men, as prescribed in the preceding article, shall be repeated
for each cause to be tried, unless the court shall dispense
with this formality, or unless the parties shall consent to call
the names of the jurymen in any other manner they choose.
§ 499. When the list of the jurymen present shall have
been formed in the manner above specified, or when the
court shall have ordered, or the parties agreed, to call them
in any other manner, the jurymen shall be called three at
a time to be sworn; the parties must then make their chal
lenges to the court, if they have any cause therefor, either to
the array or to the poll.
Acts 1826, p. 46; 1877, p. 72, No. 66, Orleans.
§ 500. Challenges may be made to the array, or to the
poll.
§ 501. A challenge to the array may be made for any
irregularity in the manner of summoning the jurymen, or of
drawing their names.
But it shall not be deemed a good cause to challenge the
array; that a number of jurors actually drawn at any time
was not the exact number required by law; and although
one or more of the jurymen on the list should lack the quali
fication required by law, it shall not be cause sufficient to
challenge the whole array, but any such juror may be chal
lenged peremptorily by either party.
24 A. 259; D. Sec. 2130.
§ 502. Challenges to the polls are divided into two
kinds, one founded on legal and sufficient reasons, another
which depends on the will of the parties, without their being
obliged to make known their motives for so doing.
D. Sec. 2131, 2134. Acts 1855, p. 297.
§ 503. Challenges to the polls, the causes of which the
parties are bound to declare and approve, or those which are
founded:
1. Upon the juryman's not having the qualifications re
quired by law;
2. Upon his being suspected of some partiality or favor for
one of the parties ;
3. Upon his having been convicted of some crime or mis-
demeanor, which legally renders him incapable of acting as
a juryman. No juror shall be challenged by either party,
on the ground that he is exempted by law from serving on
juries, nor on the ground that he is related or allied to either
party, unless such relationship or alliance be within the sixth
degree, according to the computation of the civil law.
§ 504. The causes of challenge which have been men
tioned in the preceding article are to be understood in the
sense and under the modifications hereafter mentioned.
§ 505. A juryman may excuse himself, if he fills any
public functions, which by their nature or the provisions of
law exempt him from serving as a juryman.
§ 506. A juryman may be challenged because he does
not possess the qualification required by law.
This qualification is, that the juryman must be a duly
qualified elector, without regard to race, color or previous
condition.
§ 507. A juryman maybe challenged, as suspected of
partiality in the cause :
1. If he be a domestic, counsellor, attorney, agent, or part

committed, if he has been convicted of any crime deemed
infamous by the penal laws of this State.
§ 509. The juryman challenged for any one of the above

ing the truth of the facts alleged against him; and he must

he do not expose himself to injure his reputation, or accuse
himself of some crime or misdemeanor.
§ 510. The judge shall pronounce upon the challenges
to jurymen in the same manner as upon those made to wit
nesses; and the party, who may think himself aggrieved by
his decision, may, in like manner, take an exception to his
opinion.
Acts 1877, p. 72; No. 56 ; C P. 488, 517.
§ 511. Besides the challenges, the causes of which the
parties must declare and prove as above, the plaintiff and de
fendant have each the right of challenging peremptorily
four jurymen.
§ 512. When there are many plaintiffs or'defeudants in
a cause, the parties who are equally interested will be obliged
to join, in order to enjoy the right of challenging which has
been mentioned in the preceding article, so that there may
be no more than four jurymen peremptorily challenged, on
each side.
§ 513. If, on account of the challenges, absence, or sick
ness, of some of the jurymen, or of any other legal excuse,
the jury should not be complete, the court shall order the
sheriff to summon a certain number of persons present, hav
ing the legal qualifications, in order to complete it.
Acts 1841, p. 56.
§ 514. As soon as a juryman shall have been accepted
by the parties, or the challenge made to him shall have been
overruled by the court, he shall take an oath, that he will
pronounce, in a just and impartial manner, and to the best of
his judgment, in the case of such a one against such a one,
(naming the title of the cause,) which is about to be submitted
to him ; and as soon as there shall be twelve jurymen sworn,
tho court shall name, from amongst them, a foreman, who
shall preside over them, and sign the verdict which they may
render.
§ 515. The case shall be pleaded before the jury in the
same manner as before the court; and when the pleadings
are finished, the judge shall charge the jury on the form of
giving their verdict.
In all cases appealable to the Supreme Court, it shall be
the duty of the judge to deliver his charge to the jury in
writing if the counsel of either party require the same.
§ 516. In this charge the judge must limit himself to
giving the jury a knowledge of the laws applicable to the
cause submitted to them, and he shall abstain from saying
anything about the facts, or even recapitulating them, so as
to exercise any influence on their decision, in this respect.

§ 517. If, when the judge shall have finished his charge
to the jury, one of the parties believes that the judge has
mistaken the law, which he has stated to the jury, or in the
application which he has made of it, he may require the
judge to give his opinion in writing, touching this matter,
and on his refusal he may take an exception, in the manner
and form heretofore set forth.

§ 518. When the jury shall have retired into the room
designated for this purpose, they shall deliberate under the
direction of their foreman upon their verdict, and as soon
as they shall have agreed upon the manner of giving it, the
foreman shall reduce the verdict to writing, and sign it, as
is hereafter mentioned, and give notice to the court, if it be
still in session, that the jury are ready to give their verdict.
§ 519. The verdict may be either general or special. A
general verdict is that by which the jury pronounce at the
same time on the fact and the law, either in favor of the
plaintiff or defendant.
A special verdict is that by which the jury pronounces on
the facts only, leaving to the court the right of giving judg
ment on these facts and the law applicable to them.

162; 10 A. 418; 14 A. 704.
§ 520. The jury is always at liberty to give a general
verdict, by pronouncing on the law and on the fact, in the
case submitted to them.
Therefore, the law permitting either party to submit spec
ially the facts in the case, to the jury, and so depriving
them of the right of giving a general verdict in the suit, is
abrogated.
8 L. 33; 10 L. 81; 12 R. 162.
§ 521. But, should the jury think proper to render a
special verdict on the facts of the cause, those facts which
the jury shall have found shall be considered as true, and the
judge shall render judgment accordingly, saving the right
of granting a new trial, if he believe that the jury have
given their verdict contrary to the evidence.
5 R. 78; 20 A 455, 458.
§ 522. The form of a general verdict consists in the
foreman endorsing on the back of the petition, these words:
"verdict for the plaintiff for so much, with interest," if it
has been prayed for; or verdict for the defendant," accord
ing as the verdict is for plaintiff or defendant.

A. 166; 30 A. 734.
§ 523. The jury has nothing to do with the costs in a
general verdict, inasmuch as it is entirely reserved for the
court to pronounce on this subject, which is a consequence
of its judgment.
§ 524. When the verdict Is special, the foreman must
write on the petition, or on a separate eheet of paper, and
successively, the different facts which they find in the cause.
5 R. 78.
§ 525. Whether the verdict be general or special, the
foreman must sign it, mentioning his quality.
8 L. 275.
§ 526. When the jury have returned into court, in order
to give in their verdict, the judge shall order the clerk to call
the jurymen, to ascertain that they are all present; and if
the jury be all present, the foreman shall hand the verdict to
the judge, who shall order the clerk to read it, in a loud and
intelligible voice.
§ 527. After the reading of the verdict, he shall ask the
jury if the verdict has been agreed to, and if the foreman
answer affirmatively, he shall enter the verdict on the records
of the court, unless one of the parties require that the jury
be called and each of them asked if he has agreed to the ver
dict, and if it appear that nine or more of the jurors have
agreed to the verdict, the same shall be recorded.
Act 1880, No. 116, am'd and re'd; 32 A. 224.
§ 528. If, on reading the verdict, it appear that there is
some want of form as to the manner in which It has been
drawn, it may be corrected at the request of either of the
parties, under the direction of the court, either in their pres
ence, or after the jury shall have retired for that purpose, in
which case it shall again be brought into court after having
been corrected, in order to be read and recorded, as above
directed.

§ 529. If the court intend adjourning to the next day,
previous to the jury having brought in their verdict, they
may authorize them after they have agreed on their verdict,
to deliver the same, sealed, to the olerk of the court, in or
der that it be read the following day, at the opening ol the
court.
In such case, the jury must attend in court to be present
at the reading of their verdict.
7N. S.225 ; 8 N. S. 274.
§ 530. If, pending the adjournment, some member of
the jury have fallen sick, so as to be unable to be present in
the court when the verdict is read, the court may commission
a justice of the peace to take the declaration on oath, of such
juror as to the manner in which he voted, at the time the
verdict was agreed to, unless the parties agree to dispense
with his declaration.
§ 531. If a juror die during the adjournment, the court
shall examine, on oath, either the foreman or any other
member of the jury, in order to ascertain the manner in
which the deceased voted at the time the verdict was agreed
to, and the testimony of such juror shall have the same
effect as the declaration of the deceased would have had,
were he alive.
§ 532.. The plaintiff, until the moment when the jury
shall be about to withdraw, is at liberty, on paying the costs,
to discontinue his suit; but if the plaintiff allow the jury to
withdraw, before discontinuing his suit, the verdict shall be
binding on him.

the same be for a specific sum, as security for the payment
of the amount of such judgment, in case the same is affirmed
by the court to which the appeal is taken ; provided further,

vency to the satisfaction of the court, whenever it is ques
tioned by any party interested in the appeal. Appeal bonds,
in all cases of appeal, shall be made payable to the clerk of
the court which rendered the judgment appealed from, and,
any appellee interested in the appeal shall have recourse on
such appeal bonds against the appellant and the securities
on the appeal bond, for any liability that may accrue in favor
of the appellee on account of such appeal.
Whenever judgment has been rendered in a suit in which
the defendant has had personal service to appear and file
his answer, or when judgment has been rendered in a case
after answer filed by the defendant, or by his counsel, the
party cast in the suit shall be considered duly notified of
the judgment by the fact of its being signed by the judge ;
provided, that in the country parishes no execution shall

§ 606. The vices of form for which a judgment can be
annulled are the following:
1. If a judgment has been rendered, even contradictorily,
against a person disqualified by law from appearing in a
suit, as a minor, without the assistance of his curator or
tutor, or a married woman without the authorization of her
husband or of the court;
2. If the defendant, although qualified to appear in a cause,
have been condemned by default, without having been cited;
3. When the judgment, though clothed with all the neces
sary formalities, has, nevertheless, been given by a judge in
competent to try the suit, either owing to the amount in dis
pute, or to the nature of the cause;
4. If the defendant has not been legally cited, and has not
entered appearance, joined Issue, or had not a regular judg
ment by default taken against him.

§ 607. A definitive judgment may be annulled in all
cases where it appears that it has been obtained through
fraud, or other ill-practices on the part of the party in whose
favor it was rendered; as if he had obtained the same by
bribing the judge or the witnesses, or by producing forged
documents, or by denying having received the payment of a
sum, the receipt of which the defendant had lost or could
not find at the time, but has found since the rendering of
the judgment.

CHAPTER VII.
OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS.
§ION I.
General Provisions.
§ 617. The execution of judgments belongs to the courts
by which the causes have been tried in the first instance,
whether such judgments have been affirmed or reversed on
appeal.
C. P. 285, 617, 629, 746; 7 N. S. 658; 7 L. 409; 6 R. 427; 12 R.
519; 9 A. 301; 13 A. 253; 30 A. 506, 1229.
§ 618. Therefore the court of appeal, whether it affirm
or reverse the judgment, or whether it has rendered another
definitive judgment in the cause, must send the same to the
Inferior court, in order that it may be executed.
C. P. 915; 7 N. S. 347 ; 6 R. 92; 18 A. 606.
§ 619. This judgment can not even be executed, until it
has been recorded in the records of the inferior court which
■first had cognizance of the cause.
6 R 92.
§ 620. This recording shall be directed to be made by
the party wishing to make use of the judgment, but without
any obligation on his part to give previous notice to the op
posite party ; and the clerks of the district courts shall Dave
the power to receive, file and record, all mandates and de
crees rendered by the Supreme Court, and to issue all legal
process thereon. *
§ 621. It is also the duty of the party wishing to avail
himself of the judgment, to follow up the execution of it,
according to the delays and forms hereafter provided.
§ 622. If the judgment has been rendered where no
appeal lies, or on confession of one of the parties, the party
wishing to make use of it, may prosecute the execution im
mediately after the close of the term, excepting in the first
district.
20 A. 285.
§ 623. If the judgment has been confirmed, or a new
one rendered on the appeal, which pronounces definitively
on the cause, the execution may be prayed for, as soon as
the judgment has been recorded in the inferior court, to.
which the execution is remanded.
6 R. 92; 9 A. 301; 20 A. 522.
§ 624. Eespecting judgments subject to appeal, the
party in whose favor one is rendered can only proceed to the
execution after ten days, counting from the notification which
he is obliged to make to the opposite party, if the latter has
not appealed from the judgment within this interval, or if,
having appealed, he has failed to furnish the security neces
sary to stop execution; provided, that whenever an answer
has been filed in a suit, in which the defendant has had per
sonal service made upon him to appear and file his answer,
or when a judgment has been rendered in a case after answer
filed by the defendant, or by the counsel, the party cast in
the suit shall be considered duly notified of the j udgment, by
the fact of its being signed by the judge; provided, that in
the country parishes no execution shall issue in cases where
an appeal lies, until ten days after adjournment of the court
by which the judgment was rendered, within which delay a
party may take a suspensive appeal, on filing petition and
appeal bond, as now provided by law.
§ 625. A party wishing for the execution of a judgment
which has been rendered in his favor, may apply for this pur
pose to the clerk of the court having cognizance of the case
in the first instance, who shall deliver to him an order of
execution, according to the particulars of the judgment
which has been pronounced, as is declared hereafter.
§ 626. This order must be sealed with the seal of the
court, and signed by the clerk, who shall direct it to the
sheriff, with orders to execute it, according to its contents; or
according to the directions ot the judgment to which the
writ may refer, and to make this return to the court of the
manner in which he shall have executed the writ.
§ 627. In this case, and in all others where the sheriff
is charged with the execution of an order of the court, he
must, on receiving it, indorse on it the day of the week,
month and year on which it is delivered to him.
§ 628. Orders of execution are different, according to
the nature of the judgments to be executed; for these judg
ments may direct that a thing shall be given, or a thing be
done or omitted, or a sum of money be paid, and this variety
subjects the execution to different rules, which are explained
in the two following sections:
15 A. 573; 21 A. 741.
§ 629. It is for the court, whether appellate or inferior,
which has rendered the judgment, to take cognizance of the
manner of its execution, when the proper manner of exe
cuting it is to be determined.
C. P. 617; 4 N. S. 390; 7 N. S. 658; 8 L. 580; 6 R. 92, 427; 9 A.
496; It A. 496; 13 A. 253; 18 A. 103; 20 A. 522; 30 A. 506.
§ION II.
Of the Execution of Judgments, which Require Something to
be Given or Something to be Done.
§ 630. When the judgment directs one of the parties to
deliver an estate to the other, the clerk must issue a writ of
possession, by which the sheriff shall be enjoined to put him
in whose favor the judgment was rendered in possession of
the estate and the appurtenances belonging to it, according
to the judgment.
C. P. 1058; 7 L. 409, 416; 9 L. 273; 15 A. 573.
§ 631. This writ of possession shall be directed to the
sheriff, with a copy of the judgment, and even of the petition
to which it refers, if the party require it, to the end that the
sheriff may not be mistaken concerning the nature of the
estate and appurtenances of which he is to give the posses
sion.
7 L. 228, 406, 416; 9 L. 273 ; 7 A. 578; 15 A. 573.
§ 632. If, three days after the sheriff shall have served
a copy of this writ on the party who has been condemned to
quit the estate, he shall refuse to obey the order and to go
off, the sheriff shall proceed to put in fuH possession of the
estate the party who has obtained the judgment, and shall
compel the other to depart, even by breaking open the doors,
if it be necessary, and by summoning the posse comitatus,
if resistance be made.
C. P. 762.
§ 633. The party against whom the judgment has been
rendered shall be considered to have complied with it, by
quitting the estate, and leaving the other party free to take
possession.
7 N. S. 360, 380, 653; 15 L. 320.
§ 634. If the judgment should order the delivery of a
specific object, the writ shall direct the sheriff, on failure of
the debtor to deliver to him the specific object, after three
days' service of a copy of the writ, to seize the object wher
ever it may be found, and deliver it to the party in whose
favor the judgment was rendered.
§ 635. If the party who has been condemned to deliver
an object conceals it, or carries it out of the jurisdiction of
the court, so that the sheriff can not seize it, the party in
whose favor the judgment was rendered shall have the choice
either of instituting an action for damages, or of compelling
a specific execution of tne judgment, by obtaining a seques
tration of his other property, until he has satisfied it, in the
same manner as is practiced on judgments directing a spe
cific performance, as is stated below.
§ 636. When the judgment orders, not the delivering,
but the doing or refraining from something specified in it, if
the party condemned, on demand made by the sheriff that
he shall comply with it, refuses or neglects to do so, and this
refusal or neglect appears by a certificate of the sheriff,
the party in whose favor the judgment was rendered may
obtain, on motion, an order to distrain all the property mov
able and immovable of the party who is in default, until he
shall have fully satisfied the judgment.
C. C. 1927 (1921); C. P. 1058; 7 N. 8. 8; 10 L. 14; 11 L. 498; 2
A. 760; 15 A. 223.
§ 637. It is the duty ol the sheriff, charged with the
execution of this order of distringas, to seize without delay
the movable and immovable property of the party in
default, and to receive the rents, income and other profits,
and to keep the whole subject to the order of the court, until
the order shall be revoked.
C. C. 463 (454); 1 A. 435; 23 A. 61; 33 A. 565.
§ 638. Nevertheless, the court may, from time to time,
when the nature of the case requires it, order that the sums
arising from the income thus collected shall be paid to the
party in whose favor the judgment was rendered, if he de
mands it, and gives good and sufficient security to refund
the sums thus paid to him, when the judgment of the court
shall have been complied with, and he shall have been paid
the expenses and damages which may be allowed to him, as
provided in the following article:
§ 639. The judge may quash the order of distringas, if
it be proved to him that the party condemned has fully sat
isfied the judgment, and has paid all the damages which he
has the power of granting to the other party.
§ 640. As soon as the sheriff shall have executed the
writs of possession and order of distringas which were di
rected to him, he must return into the court which issued
them, the originals of these writs, with his return endorsed,
stating the manner in which they have been executed, and
the particulars of the property distrained, in case the order
of distringas was issued.
§ION in.
Of the Execution of Judgments directing the Payment of a
sum of Money.
i L
Of the Writ of Fieri Facias.
§ 641. When the judgment orders the payment of a
sum of money, the party in whose favor it is rendered may
apply to the clerk and obtain from him a writ of fieri facias
against the property of his debtor.
C. P. 625; 4 N. S. 197; 5 N. S. 287, 419, 707; 7 N. S. 156; 8 N. S.
391; 7 L. 273; 9 R. 267; 9 A. 496; 14 A. 503, 832; 15 A. 188; 21 A.
741; 24 A. 297: D. Sec. 386, 3458-3466. Acts 1855, pp. 253, 477;
Act Ex. S. 1870, p. 10, n. 5, Orleans; D. 1508, 3407.
§ 642. This writ is directed to the sheriff of the parish
where the property of the debtor is situated, and orders him
to seize the property, real and personal, rights and credits of
the debtor, and to sell them to satisfy the judgment obtained
against him; and all writs of fieri facias, issued by the clerks
of the several courts throughout the State, shall be made
returnable by them in not less than thirty, nor more than
seventy days.
And whenever a party plaintiff in a cause has applied for
a writ of fieri facias against the defendant, and has reason
to believe that a third person has property or effects in his
possession, or under his control belonging to the defendant,
or is indebted to him, he may cause such third person to be
cited to answer under oath, such interrogatories as may be
propounded to him, touching said property and effects, or
such indebtedness, in the same manner and with the same
regulations as are provided in relation to garnishees in
cases of attachment, and pursuant to special laws.
It shall be lawful for any judgment creditor, entitled to
execution, to issue several writs of fieri facias to different
parishes at the same time ; provided, that when the property
of any defendant in execution shall be under seizure, in dif
ferent parishes, at the same time, such defendant shall have
the right to have a reduction of the seizures, which shall
have been so made, upon showing that the amount of prop
erty so seized is more than sufficient to satisfy his creditor's
judgment ; and provided, also, that such seizing creditors
shall be liable to pay the defendant in execution such dam
ages as the latter may have sustained in consequence of any
excessive seizures made at his instance.
And in all cases, except in the parish of Orleans, where a
seizure of property shall have been made under a writ of
fieri facias, and the officer making such seizure shall not be
able to sell such property before the return day of the writ,
such officer shall, nevertheless, make due return of such
writ : but, at the time of making such return, he shall make
and retain a copy of the writ, duly certified by himself ; and
it shall be his duty to proceed under such certified copy, in
the same manner as though the original writ was in his
hands, and to make due return thereon ; and in the parish
of Orleans, the officer, at the time of making return as afore
said, shall cause to be made by the clerk of the court, issu
ing said writ, a duly certified copy thereof ; and it shall be
the duty of such clerk to deliver said duly certified copy to
said officer, within twenty-four hours from the time of filing
such original writ and return thereon ; and the officer shall
proceed, under such certified copy so furnished him, in the
same manner as though the original writ was in his hands,
and to make due return thereon.
§ 643. As soon as the sheriff has received this writ, he
must execute it, without delay, by seizing the property of
the debtor, which he shall find in his parish, except such
things as are mentioned in the following article.

nor those of his family ; nor his arms and military accoutre
ments ; nor the tools and instruments and books, sewing
machines necessary for the exercise of his or her calling,
trade or profession by which he makes a living ; nor shall
he in any case seize the rights of personal servitude, of use
and habitation, of usufruct to the estate of a minor child ;
nor the income of dotal property ; nor money due for the
salary of an officer, nor wages, nor recompense for personal
services, nor household and kitchen furniture to the value of
six hundred dollars.

seized and offered for sale, on the same terms as every other

§ 690. The adjudication thus made has, of itself alone,
the effect of transferring to the purchaser all the rights and
claims which the party in whose hands it was seized might
have had to the thing adjudged.
§ 691. Within three days after the adjudication, the
sheriff shall pass an act of sale to the purchaser of the
property or effects adjudged by him, in the manner and
form hereafter directed.

of fieri facias, or of seizure and sale, and the said sheriff
shall have died, resigned, or been removed from office, or
shall die, resign, or be removed from office, without having
passed an act of sale to such purchaser, it shall be lawful,
and the duty of his immediate or other successor in office,

effect of the adjudication, but is only intended to afford the
proof of it.

ties above prescribed, the adjudication shall not be void on
that account, if it otherwise appear that it was made by virtue
of a legal authority, and with all the forms requisite for its
validity.

property, and the judgment creditor is unable to point out
any, the sheriff shall return the execution into court, after

after due demand, shall have the right to compel his debtor
to make a surrender of his property, by proceeding in the

§ 731. If a debtor against whom a warrant of impris

a confession of judgment, and which contains a privilege or
mortgage in his favor.
2. When the creditor demands the execution of a judg
ment which has been rendered by a tribunal of this State
different from that within whose jurisdiction the execution
Is sought.
The proceeding by provisional seizure (attachment) or in
rem, resembles in some sort the executory process, but
should not be confounded with it, as they are subject to dif
ferent rules.
§ 733. An act is said to import a confession of judg
ment in matters of privilege and mortgage, when it is
passed before a notary public, or other officer fulfilling the
same functions, in the presence of two witnesses, and the
debtor has declared or acknowledged the debt for which he
gives the privilege or mortgage.

tue or under pretext of a judicial order, the copy of such
order shall be annexed to the petition, or the petitioner
shall allege that a copy of it has been demanded and
refused.

virtue of a judicial order, regular in its form, but illegally
obtained or executed, the petition shall mention in what the
illegality consists.

his custody ; and by making on the back of the order, or
separately, his answer in writing, in the form and manner
hereafter directed.
§ 807. The person on whom a habeas corpus is served
shall declaie positively in his answer;
1. Whether lie has or lias not iu his power or custody the
person to be set at liberty, or whether that person is con
fined by him ;
2. By what authority and for what cause he arrested or
detained him.
§ 808. If the person on whom a habeas corpus is served
had held the petitioner in confinement, or had detained him
within three days preceding the service, or had transferred
the custody to another, he shall state particularly iu his an
swer to whom, at what time, for what cause, and by what
authority he made the transfer.
§ 809. If the petitioner be kept in custody by virtue of
a judicial order, the original of that order must be annexed
to the answer.
§ 810. This answer must be signed and sworn to by the
person making it.
§ 811. Whenever a habeas corpus sh,ill have been
obtained for a person who is confined by virtue of n final
judgment or order of any competent tribunal of civil or
criminal jurisdiction, the officer having the legal custody of
such person need not produce him unless specially ordered
to do so, notwithstanding such final judgment in the cases
laid down in the following article, and it shall besuffiiient
for him to return the habeas corpus, with his answer in
writing, annexing the judgment or order by virtue of which
the person is confined.
§ 812. The judge may direct that the person confined
shall be produced before him, notwithstanding any final
judgment, sentence, or order under which he may have been
deprived of liberty, if it appears to him that from some
cause expressed in the affidavit on which the habeas corpus
was granted, or in the answer accompanying the return of
the writ, this production is necessary to enable hiui to grant
the patty the relief prayed lor.
§ 813. The return of a habeas corpus shall be made in
twelve hours after its service, or sooner if it be so ordered
by the wrir, in every case where the place of confinement is
not more than twelve miles from that to which the return is
to be made.
If the person confined is at a greater distance, the time
for the return shall be increased one day for every twenty
milt s' distance, and so in proportion for shorter distances.
§ 814. When the habeas corpus has been duly served, if
the party in whose favor it has been granted is not produced
within the time above fixed, the judge who issued the writ
shall issue a warrant to some officer ot justice, commanding
him to arrest and take in charge the person who disobeyed
the writ, and to bring such person before him to be pro
ceeded against according to law.
§ 815. If the person thus brought before the judge re
fuses to deliver t he habeas corpus which has been served'
upon him, or to produce the party whom lie was ordered to
produce in the cases where, according to the above pro
visions, he might be compelled to do it, he shall be sent to
prison, and shall remain there until he obt ys the habeas cor
pus; and shall be condemned to pay all the costs of the pro
ceedings, besides the action for false imprisonment which
the party may institute against him.
§ 816. Whenever by reason of the sickness or infirmity
of the party confined, he can not be brought, before the judge
without endangering his life, he who has him in confinement
shall mention it in his answer on returning the habeas cor-
P".s, and if this fact be proved by the certificate of a phy
sician or surgeon regularly authorized to practice, and by
the declaration of two other witnesses, and the signature of
the party confined, if he can write, if the answer appears to
him sufficient in other respects, the judge shall repair to the
place where the party is confined, if he can do it without
quitting the place of holding his usual sittings, otherwise he
may determine on the habeas corpus in the same manner as
if the party was produced before him.
§ 817. If the person confining the petitioner can not
produce him because he is dead, or through some other un
avoidable accident or overpowering force, he shall mention
it in his answer to the writ; but this fact, to form an excuse,
must be proved in a perfectly satisfactory manner to the
judge.
It is to be understood that in this case, and in every other
where the person confining another is bound to make proof
of the causes which prevent producing him, proof to the
contrary may be offered by the person who obtained the
habeas corpus.
§ 818. If the person kept in confinement is represented
before the judge, he may deny all the facts stated in the an
swer to the habeas corpus, or he may allege others on his
side to show that his detention or imprisonment is illegal, or
that he has a right to be set at liberty ; which denials and
allegations shall be made under oath.
§ 819. The judge shall then proceed in a summary
manner to hear the testimony and the reasons adduced, as
well by the party confined as by the party confining, and
shall pronounce on the whole subject as the nature of the
case may require, and according to the rules hereafter estab
lished.
§ 820. If the judge can not pronounce immediately on
the habeas corpus, he may, until his judgment is rendered,
commit the party to the sheriff of the parish where the writ
is issued, or to such other person as the age of the party
and other circumstances may render proper.
§ 821. If it appear to the judge, by the return to the
habeas corpus, or by the documents which accompany that
return, that the person whose liberation is solicited, is de
tained by virtue of an order rendered in a civil suit, or at
the request of any individual having an interest in his con
finement, the said judge shall not pronounce on the habeas
corpus, unless it be proved to his satisfaction that previous
reasonable notice in writing has been given to the plaintiff in
such civil action, or to any other party interested, or his
agent or attorney, if they are not more than twenty miles'
distant from the place where the habeas corpus has been ob
tained.
§ 822. If it appears to the judge, from the return to the
writ or from the accompanying documents, that the party is
confined by the order of some tribunal, he can only restore
such party to liberty in the following cases :
1. Where such tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction, as
defined by law ;
2. Where the original imprisonment was lawful, but by
some act, omission, or event which has since occurred, the
party becomes entitled to his liberty;
3. Where the order of imprisonment is .deficient in some
legal requisite;
4. Where the order, although in due legal form, has been
rendered in a case where the law does not allow the issuing
of orders of arrest or imprisonment;
5. Where the order is in due form, but has been rendered
or executed by a person not authorized for that purpose, or
where the person detaining the prisoner is not the person to
whom the law has prescribed that duty;
6. Where the order appears to have been obtained under
false pretences or by corruption;
7. Where there exists no general law, judgment, order, or
decree of a court of justice, if it be in a civil suit, or sentence
of conviction, if in a criminal suit, to justify the imprison
ment.
§ 823. The judge pronouncing on the habeas corpus can
no otherwise examine the validity or propriety of the judg
ment or decree of a regularly constituted tiibunal under
whicn the imprisonment has taken place; and whenever it
shall appear to him that there exists sufficient legal ground
for the detention of the prisoner, on account of any offence
with which he may be charged, al. hough the order of im
prisonment may have been rendered in an irregular and
unauthorized manner, or have been executed by a person not
duly authorized for the purpose, the judge shall render a
new order of arrest, in regular form, directed to the proper
officer, or admit the party to bail, if the nature of the offence
allows it.
§ 821. But if it shall appear to the judge from return
and annexed documents, or otherwise, that there is no cause
for arrest or confinement, or if he thinks that such arrest
and confinement can not legally continue, he shall immedi
ately set the piisoner at liberty.
§ 825. But if the judge decide that the party can not be
released from confinement, nor admitted to bail he shall
remand him to prison, or place him under the same custody
in which he was, if the detention was legal; otherwise he
shall place him in the custody of the person to whom the
law con fides such duties.
§ 826. A party discharged from imprisonment under a
habean corp.ix, in a criminal proceeding, through deficiency of
proof, or some important defect in the warrant of imprison
ment, may be arrested and confined anew, on satisfactory
proof and under a legal warraut, although it be for the same
offence.
§ 827. So, also, in a civil suit, a party who has been
released on account of illegality of the warrant under which
he is confined, or want of authority in the person confining
him, may be arrested anew ami imprisoned for the same
cause of action, provided it be done in a legal manner.
§ 829. Besides the habeas corpus, there are four other
species of orders which courts of justice may issue, to wit:
1. The order directing the performance of some specific
act; (writ of mandamus.)
2. The order forbi ldiug further proceedings in a suit;
(writ of prohibition.)
3. The order of which the object is to pronounce on the
validity of a judicial proceeding; (writ of certiorari.)
4. The or ler of which the object is to prevent an usurpa
tion; (writ of quo warranto)

try a mandamus in chambers during the recess of said courts.
§ 831. This order may be issued at the discretion of
the judge, even when a party has other means of relief, if

such a delay that the public good and the administration of
justice will suffer from it.

mandate for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of a
proceeding in the last resort, if judgment has been rendered
and execution sued out in the court below, it may arrest the
execution, by enjoining the party suing it and the officer
charged with it to proceed no further until the validity of
the proceedings has been pronounced upon, and this under
the same penalties which are inflicted for contempt of court.

may demand a further time to bring it up, which may be
granted by the court if the event causing the delay be
proved to its satisfaction ; the court may even grant an in

§ 897. The appellant who does not rely wholly or in
part on the statement of facts, an exception to the judge's
opinion, or special verdict, to sustain his appeal, but on an
error of law appearing on the face of the record, shall be
allowed to allege such error, if, within ten days after the
record is brought up, he files in the Supreme Court a written
paper, stating especially such errors as he alleges; otherwise
his appeal shall be rejected.

§ 898. If, at the time of argument, or before, the appel
lant perceives that the copy of the record is incomplete,
either through mistakes or omissions, or from the clerk
having failed to certify the copy as containing all the testi
mony produced in the cause, or from any similar irregulari
ties not arising from any act of the appellant, the court may
grant him a reasonable time to correct such errors or omis
sions, during which time judgment on the appeal shall be
suspended. And no appeal to the Supreme Court shall be
dismissed on account of any defect, error, or irregularity in
the petition or order of appeal, or in the certificate of the
clerk or judge, or in the citation of appeal or service thereof,
or because the appeal was not made returnable at the next
term of the Supreme Court, whenever it shall not appear
that such defect, error, or irregularity is imputable to the
appellant; but in all such cases the court shall grant a
reasonable time to correct such errors or irregularities, (in
case they are not waived by the appellee,) and may impose
upon the appellant such terms and conditions as in their
discretion they may deem necessary for the attainment of
justice, and may also impose such fines on the officer, who
shall have caused such irregularities, as they may deem pro
portioned to the offences.
§ 899. If the record be incomplete, because the judge
below refused to perform any of his duties, as to sign the ex
ceptions to his opinion, or if such imperfection proceed from
a similar refusal by the clerk, the Supreme Court shall direct
a mandate to such judge or clerk, ordering him to perform
the duty imposed on him by law or by the nature of his
office, and in the meantime it shall suspend its judgment on
the appeal.
C. P. 855 et seq,; 5 N. S. 90; 13 A. 484; 21 A. 268, 278.
§ 900. When a party desiring to appeal from the judg
ment of the lower court can not obtain a statement of facts
from the judge, or his signature to exceptions from his
opinion, upon motion the Supreme Court shall direct a man
date ordering him to perform his duty, provided said motion
be made on the first day of the term succeeding the refusal
of the judge.
12 L. 437.
§ 901. When the Supreme Court once has jurisdiction
of an appeal, whether by transmission of the record, or by
that of the citation served on the appellee, it can not, in any
case, permit the appellant to withdraw his appeal, without
the consent of the appellee, and the cause shall take its
course, whether the appellant make default or not.
§ 902. Although in general, parties before the Supreme
Court are not allowed to plead other matters than those
which were before the inferior court, nevertheless it may
depart from this rule, when the exception taken is one of
those which may be pleaded at any period of a cause, and
the proof of it appears by the mere examination of the
record.
The prescription may be pleaded before the Supreme
Court when the proof of it appears on the face of the pro
ceeding in the lower court. But the party to whom it is
opposed shall have the privilege of demanding that the
cause be remanded for trial upon that plea.

the suit, his heir may be made a party in his place.

or's right of appeal.

§ 905. When the Supreme Court reverses the judg
ment of an inferior court, it shall pronounce on the case the
judgment which the lower court should have rendered, if it
be in possession of all the facts and testimony to enable it
to pronounce definitively.

§ 906. But if the court shall think it not possible to
pronounce definitively on the cause, in the state in which it
is, either because the parties have failed to adduce the neces
sary testimony, or because the inferior court refused to
receive it, or otherwise, it may, according to circumstances,
remand the cause to the lower court with instructions as to
the testimony which it shall receive, to the end that it may
decide according to law.

shall not exceed ten per cent, on the value of the amount
in dispute.

§ 1096. In causes within their jurisdiction, justices may
issue orders of arrest, injunction, attachment, sequestration
and provisional seizure, according to the rules hereafter pro
vided.
§ 1097. Every creditor for an amount within the juris
diction of a justice of the peace, may have his debtor arrested
and compel him to give security to appear, if the debtor is
about to depart from the State or from the parish where he
has his domicile, or if he has no domicile in the State.
§ 1098. The creditor wishing to arrest his debtor shall
make his demand before any competent justice of the peace,
to have the debtor cited and condemned to pay the sum due,
and that he be at the same time required to give security to
appear and answer the said demand.
§ 1099. But this arrest shall only be ordered by the
justice, on the creditor making an affidavit that the de
fendant is really indebted to him in the sum demanded,
stating such sum precisely; and such affidavit shall also
state that the creditor really believes that his debtor is about
to depart from the State or parish of his domicile, before
judgment can be obtained against him, and that such debtor
does not, to his knowledge, possess any property in the
State to satisfy the demand.
§ 1100. When the demand shall be brought against a
person having no domicile in the State, the creditor may
have him arrested and held to bail, by declaring in his affi
davit that such creditor has no domicile in the State, with
out being obliged to declare he is about to depart, but in
other respects taking the same oath as required in the pre
ceding article, provided, that no citizen of another State
shall hereafter be arrested in this State, at the suit of a res
ident or non-resident creditor, except in cases where it shall
be made appear, by the oath of the creditor, that the debtor
has absconded from his residence.
§ 1101. The justice to whom this prayer for arrest shall
be made, accompanied by a suitable affidavit, shall deliver
to a constable a citation and order to arrest and bring before
him the said defendant, that he may answer to the action
brought against him.
C. P. 217.
§ 1102. The constable charged to execute this order
shall arrest the defendant on delivering to him the citation of
which he is in possession, and shall take him before the jus
tice of the peace who caused him to be cited, if the said
justice be at his office.
§ 1103. The justice shall require from the defendant
his bond in double the sum demanded, with one good and
solvent surety conditioned for his appearance on the trial of
the cause.
Act 1871, p. 18.
§ 1104. If the defendant will not or can not give the
§rity required of him, the justice shall send him to prison,
there to remain until he gives the security demanded ; or
shall be discharged from imprisonment in the manner pro
vided by law.
Act 1871, p. 18.
§ 1105. If the constable who has arrested the defend
ant does not find the justice at his office, he may take from
the defendant the security for his appearance required
above, or in default thereof conduct him to prison, by virtue
of the order which he has received.
§ 1106. It shall be the duty of the jailor of the parish
whither the defendant shall have been carried, to receive
and keep him until set at liberty by^rderof the said justice;
and for the support of the defendant while in prison, the
plaintiff shall pay to such jailor, weekly and in advance, the
sum of three dollars and fifty cents.
§ 1107. The justice of the peace to whom the plaintiff
shall apply for the arrest of his debtor shall require from
him such sum as ought to be advanced to the jailor on de
livering the debtor into his custody ; and in all civil actions
brought before them, justices of the peace may demand se
curity for the costs.
§ 1108. The bond to be furnished by the debtor under
arrest shall contain a condition that if he should depart with
out permission from the justice who caused him to be ar
rested, or should fail to appear to satisfy such judgment as
may be rendered against him, his security shall be bound to
satisfy such judgment, to the amount of his bond.
§ 1109. Even when the debt owing from a person about
to depart from the State is not yet due, the creditor may, if
the debt be one of which a justice of the peace has cogni
zance, apply to any competent justice, and procure the ar
rest of his debtor to compel him to give security for his
appearance when the debt becomes due.
§ 1110. But to obtain such order of arrest, the creditor
must make an affidavit, in which he shall declare that the
person whom he wishes to arrest is really indebted to him
in a sum which he shall specify and which is not yet due,
and that he is informed and verily believes that such debtor
means to depart permanently from the State for the purpose
of defrauding his creditors, and without leaving any prop
erty, as far as he can learn, to satisfy them.
C. P. 217.
§ 1111. In case of such arrest, the person thus brought
before a justice of the peace shall be set at liberty, if he fur
nishes to the justice his bond in double the amount in which
he is indebted, with one good and sufficient security, condi
tioned that he will surrender himself on such judgment as
may be pronounced on the debt when it becomes due, or
that his security shall pay it for him ; otherwise the justice
shall imprison such debtor until he furnish the security or
pay the debt.
§ 1112. A person who shall have become security for
another, in a cause pending before a justice of the peace,
may at any stage of the cause, provided it be before judg
ment, release himself from all responsibility on that account,
by giving up the person of the debtor to the justice who took
the bond, and who shall then imprison the debtor, unless he
give new bail.
§ 1113. The bail who wishes to give up the debtor's
person, may, if the debtor refuses to come voluntarily, or
wishes to leave the State or the jurisdiction of the justice,
without his consent, apply to the judge who took his bond,
to have the debtor arrested as provided above.
§ 1114. If the bail does not produce the body of the
debtor in execution of the final judgment which has been
obtained against him, the plaintiff may apply to the justice
who issued the execution, if the constable has made a re
turn, stating that he has found no property of the debtor,
and obtain judgment against the surety for so much as is
covered by his bond, and no more.
§ 1115. No order of arrest or imprisonment can be ob
tained in civil suits commenced against minors ; unless they
make a business of buying and selling merchandise ; or
against a woman in any civil case.
C. P. 211.
§ 1116. A person who is creditor for a sum within the
cognizance of a justice of the peace, may attach the prop
erty of his debtor, in the three following cases :
1. If his debtor resides out of the State ;
2. If the debtor is about permanently to depart from the
State;
3. If the debtor be only transiently in the State and have
no domicile in it, or so conceals himself that process of law
can not be served on him.

such predicament expressly.
C. P. 240.
§ 1118. The creditor shall moreover deliver to the
justice his bond in favor of the defendant for double the
amount of the demand, with one good and sufficient surety,
to answer such damages as the defendant may sustain, in
case the attachment should prove to be improperly obtained.
§ 1119. The justice of the peace to whom such demand
and affidavit shall be presented, shall direct to a constable
of the parish a citation against the defendant, and an order
to attach the movable property which the defendant may
have in the parish, wherever it may be found, even in the
hands of third persons, as well as such debts as may be
owing to him, although they are not yet due.
§ 1120. The constable charged with the execution of
this order, shall begin by serving on the defendant the cita
tion which is issued in the same manner as in ordinary cases,
if such defendant has domicile in the place, or if he can be
found; but in the contrary case, or if the defendant be ab
sent, the constable shall affix a copy of such citation on the
door of the court house of such parish.
§ 1121. The constable shall then proceed, without de
lay, to seize the movable property which the defendant has
in his parish, to the value of the sum due, together with in
terest and costs, and shall make a list of such property in the
presence of a credible witness, which list he shall deliver to
the justice issuing the order of seizure, on making his return.
§ 1122. If the defendant's property consist in debts
owing to him, the constable shall attach and stop them in the
hands of the debtor, after receiving his declaration of the
amount due by him and the time when it is to be paid, and
shall make his report of it to the justice, as above directed.
§ 1123. If such debtor refuses to declare what he owes
to the defendant, the plaintiff may have him cited before the
justice of the peace to compel him to make such declaration
under oath to the justice, and if he refuses to make such
declaration or fails to appear, such refusal shall be con
sidered as an acknowledgment that he is indebted to the de
fendant in a sufficient sum to discharge the demand, and
judgment shall be rendered against him in favor of the
plaintiff.
§ 1124. If a claim be made before a justice of the peace
for a Bpecific object or any movable of a value within his
jurisdiction, the plaintiff may require that such object shall
be sequestered until judgment be had, if he make his affida
vit that he verily fears that the defendant means to remove
such object out of the said justice's jurisdiction.
C. P. 275.
§ 1125. If a demand be made for a sum due for rent
within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, the plaintiff
may demand that the furniture of the house subject to the
rent be seized provisionally, if he make an affidavit that he
is afraid of the defendant removing it from the house to de
prive him of the pledge which he has on it.
C. P. 284.
§ 1126. Whenever a plaintiff wishes to obtain an order
of seizure, attachment, sequestration, injunction, or provi
sional seizure, before a justice of the peace, the agent or
attorney of such plaintiff may be allowed to make the neces
sary oath ; provided such oath be founded on his own knowl
edge, and not on information derived from his principal.

been seized, attached, sequestered, or provisionally seized,

justice of the peace his bond with one good security in double
the amount demanded, to satisfy such judgment as shall be
rendered against him, with interest and costs.
