2d. In other actions, that if the defendant fail to answer the
complaint, the plaintiff will apply to the Court for the relief demanded
therein.
§ 27. In an action affecting the title to real property, the plaintiff at
the time of filing the complaint, or at any time afterwards, may file with
the Recorder of the county in which the property is situated, a notice of
the pendency of the action, containing the names of the parties, the
object of the action, and a description of the property in that county
affected thereby. From the time of filing only, shall the pendency of
the action be constructive notice to a purchaser or incumbranoer of the
property affected thereby.

§ 28. The summons shall be served by the Sheriff of the county

order that the service be made by the publication of the summons.
§ 31. The order shall direct the publication to be made in a news-'

§ 46. The answer of the defendant shall contain :

other person verifying the same. When the pleading is verified by the

§ 59. In pleading a judgment or other determination of a Court or

facts conferring jurisdiction.

§ 60. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such performance; but it may be stated generally that the party duly performed
all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be controverted,
the party pleading, shall establish, on the trial, the facts showing such
performance.

§ 61. In pleading a private Statute, or a right derived therefrom, it
shall be sufficient to refer to such Statute by its title and the day of
its passage, and the Court shall thereupon take judicial notice
thereof.

§ 62. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to
state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the
application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matter out of which the
cause of action arose; but it shall be stitiicient to state generally, that
the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff, and if such
allegation be controverted, the plaintiff shall establish on the trial that
it was so published or spoken.

§ 63. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant may, ‘

complaint, when they all arise out of :

lst. Contracts, express or implied; or,
2d. Claims to recover specific real property, with or without

damages, for the withholding thereof, or for waste committed thereon,
and the rents and profits of the same; or,
3d. Claims to recover specific personal property, with or without
damages, for the withholding thereof; or,
4th. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by

operation of law; or,

5th. Injuries to character; or,

6th. Injuries to person; or,

7th. Injuries to property. But the causes of action so united shall
all belong to one only of these classes, and shall affect all the parties to
the action, and not require different places of trial, and shall be separately stated.

§ 65. Every material allegation of the complaint, not specincally
controverted by the answer, shall, for the purposes of the action, be taken
as true. But the allegation of new matter in the answer shall be
deemed controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct denial, or
avoidance, as the case may require.

§ 66. A material allegation in a pleading is one essential to the
claim, or defence, and which could not be stricken from the pleading
without leaving it insutlicient.

§ 67. After the decision of a demurrer, and on the payment of the
costs of the same, the defendant may answer.

§ 68. The Court may, in furtherance of justice and on such terms
as may be proper, amend any pleading or proceeding, by adding or
striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the
name of a party or a mistake in any other respect. The Court may:
likewise, upon aHidavit showing good cause therefor, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon such terms as may be just, an amendment to
any pleading or proceedihg in other particulars; and may, upon like
terms, allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this Act,
or by an order enlarge such time ; and may, upon such terms as may
be just, and upon payment of costs, relieve a party or his legal representatives from a judgment order, or other proceeding, taken against
him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
When from any cause, the summons and a copy of the complaint in an
action have not been personally served on the defendant, the Court may
allow, on such terms as may be just, such defendant or his legal representatives, at any time within six months after the rendition of any
judgment in such action, to answer to the merits of the original action.

§ 69. When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant,
such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by
any name; and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly.

§ 70. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining its effects, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with a view to
substantial justice between the parties.

§ 71. The Court shall, in every stage of an action, disregard any 1
error or defect in the pleadings, or proceedings, which shall not affect r
the substantial rights of the parties; and no judgment shall be reversed
or affected by reason of such error or defect.

or County Clerk, at a specified time and place; the time to be not less

exempt from execution; but the Judge, or County Clerk, on justification,
may allow more than two sureties to justify severally, in amounts less
than that expressed in the order, if the whole justification be equivalent
to that of two sutiicient bail.

§ 89. For the purpose of justification, each of the bail shall attend j

theotiicial bond of the Sheriff, to collect the sum deposited, as in other
cases of delinquency.

deposit at the time of the recovery of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff,
the Clerk shall, under the direction of the Court, apply the same in
satisfaction thereof; and after satisfying the judgment, shall refund the
surplus, if any, to the defendant. If the judgment be in favor of the
defendant, the Clerk shall, under like direction of the Court, refund to
him the whole sum deposited and remaining unapplied.

§ 95. If, after being arrested, the defendant escape or be rescued, the
Sheriff shall himself be liable as bail; but he may discharge himself
from such liability, by the giving and justification of bail, at any time
before judgment. '

§ 96. If a judgment be recovered against the Sherid’, upon his liability as bail, and an execution thereon be returned unsatisfied in whole or
in part, the same proceedings may be had on his official bond, for the
recovery of the whole or any deficiency, as in other cases of delinquency.

§ 97. A defendant arrested may at any time before the justification
of bail apply to the Judge who made the order, or the Court in which
the action is pending, upon reasonable notice to the plaintiff to vacate
the order of arrest, or to reduce the amount of bail. If the application
be made upon adidan'ts, on the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose the same by affidavits or other proofs, in
addition to those on which the order of arrest was made.

shall be reduced.

or otiice to which he is entitled, and from which he is unlawfully precluded by such inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person.

§ 468. This writ shall be issued in all cases where there is not a

and place, why he has not done so. The peremptory writ shall be in a

substantial rights of the parties, and upon the supposed truth of the alle- ‘
gation of which the application for the writ is based, the Court may, in
its discretion, order the question to be tried before a jury, and postpone
the argument until such trial can be had, and the verdict certified to the
Court. The question to be tried shall be distinctly stated in the order
for trial, and the county shall be designated in which the same shall be
had. The order may also direct the jury to assess any damages which
the applicant may have sustained in case they find for him.

§ 473. On the trial, the applicant shall not be precluded by the:

§ 476. If no answer be made, the case shall be heard on the papers .
of the applicant. If an answer be made which does not raise a question
such as is mentioned in section 472, but only such matters as may be
explained or avoided by a reply, the Court may, in its discretion, grant
time for replying. If the answer, or answer and reply, raise only questions of law, or put in issue immaterial statements, not affecting the substantial rights of the parties, the Court shall proceed to hear, or fix a
day for hearing the argument of the case.
§ 477. If judgment be given for the applicant, he shall recover the

damages which he shall have sustained as found by the jury, or as may

be determined by the Court, or referees, upon a reference to be ordered,
together with costs; and for such damages and costs, an execution may
issue; and a peremptory mandate shall also be awarded without delay.

§ 478. The writ shall be served in the same manner as a summons
in a civil action, except when otherwise expressly directed by order of
the Court.

motion, impose a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars. In case of
persistance in a refusal of obedience, the Court may order the party to
be imprisoned for a period not exceeding three months, and may take
any orders necessary and proper. for the complete enforcement of the
writ. If a fine be imposed upon a judge or oHicer who draws a salary
from the State or County, a certified copy of the order shall be forwarded
