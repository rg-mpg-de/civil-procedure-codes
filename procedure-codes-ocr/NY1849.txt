order require such person or corporation, or any othcer or member
thereof, to appear at a specified time and place, and answer concerning the same. The judge may also, in his discretion. require
notice of such proceeding to be given to any party to the action,
in such manner as may seem to him proper.

or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied
towards the satisfaction of the judgment.

§ 298. The judge may also, by order, appoint a receiver of the
property of the judgment debtor, in the same manner and with
the like authority as if the appointment were made by the court,
according to section two hundred and forty-four. The judge may
also, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of the property
of the judgment debtor, not exempt from execution, and any
interference therewith.

have property of the judgment debtor or indebted to him, claims
an interest in the property, adverse to him, or denies the debt,

against such person or corporation by the receiver; but the judge
