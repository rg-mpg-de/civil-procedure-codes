heirs or devisees, without naming them; and the court shall make
such order respecting service as may be deemed proper. If service by
publication be ordered, the publication shall not be less than three weeks.
SEC. 79. Where the action is against two or more

the defendants served; and if they are subject to arrest, against the per
sons of the defendants served.
Second. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he may,
without prejudice to his rights against those not served, proceed against
the defendants served in the same manner as if they were the only
defendants.

is pending, so as to charge third persons with notice of its pendencV)
and while pending no interest can be acquired by third persons in
the subject matter thereof as against the plaintiff's title; but such notice
shall be of no avail unless the summons be served or the first publica
tion made within sixty days after the filing of the petition.
SEC. 82. When_ any part of real property, the subject
matter of an action, is situated in any other county or counties than the
one in which the action is brought, a certified copy of the judgment in

shall operate as such notice, without record, in the county where it is
rendered.

poses of the action, be taken as true; but the allegation of new matter
in the reply shall be deemed to be controverted by the adverse party, as
uPon direct denial or avoidance, as the case may require. A demurrer
to a reply shall not be held to admit any of the facts alleged in such
reply for any purpose other than to determine the sufficiency thereof.
Allegations of value, or of amount of damages, shall not be considered
as true, by failure to controvert them; but this shall not apply to the
amount claimed in actions on contract, express or implied, for the recov
ery of money only.
SEC. I29- A material allegation, in a pleading, is one
essential to the claim or defense, which could not be stricken from the
pleading without leaving it insufficient.
SEC. 130. Neither presumptions of law nor matters
of which judicial notice is taken, need be stated in the pleading.
12 Kas. 807 ;
SEC. 131. When a tender of money is alleged in any

SEC. 132. If an original pleading be lost, or withheld
jjy any person, the court may allow a copy thereof to be substituted.
MISTAKES IK PLEADING AND AMENDMENTS.
SEC. 133. No variance between the allegations, in a
pleading, and the proof, is to be deemed material, unless it have actually
misled the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or
aefense upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged that a party has been
so misled, that fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and
& must also be shown in what respect he has been misled, and there-
upon the court may order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms
as may be just.

SEC. 135. When, however, the allegation of the claim
or defense, to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in some
particular or particulars only, but in its general scope and meaning, it is
not to be deemed a case of variance within the last two sections, but a fail-
ure of proof.
SEC. 136. The plaintiff may amend his petition with-

SEC. 139. The court may, before or after judgment, in
furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any
pleading, process or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of
any party, or correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the
case, or conform the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved, when
such amendment does not change substantially the claim or defense;
and when any proceeding fails to conform, in any respect, to the provisions
of this code, the court may permit the same to be made conform-
iiiiii j , *
able thereto by amendment.

davit shall also contain a statement of the facts claimed to justify the
belief in the existence of one or more of the above particulars.
SEC. 149. The order of arrest shall not be issued by the
clerk, until there has been executed, by one or more sufficient sureties
of the plaintiff, a written undertaking to the effect that the plaintiff shall
pay to the defendant all damages which he may sustain by reason of the
arrest, if the order be wrongfully obtained, not exceeding double the
amount of the plaintiff's claim stated in the affidavit.
SEC. 150. The order may be made to accompany the
summons, or at any time afterward, before the judgment.
SEC. 151. The order of arrest shall be addressed and

and the amount of the plaintiff's claim specified in the affidavit, an d^

double the sum stated in the affidavit, and to make return of the order
on a day to be named therein, with the undertaking of the bail, if any
be given.
SEC. 152. The return day of the order of arrest, when
issued at the commencement of the suit, shall be the same as that of the
summons; when issued afterward, it shall be fifteen days after it is
issued.
SEC. 153. The sheriff shall execute the order by arresting
the defendant, and delivering to him a copy of the order, and of the
affidavit. If the defendant cannot be found before the return day, the
plaintiff shall be entitled to further orders, without another affidavit or
undertaking until the defendant is arrested; but orders of arrest shall
not be issued to any other than the county in which the action is
brought.
SEC. 154. The defendant, when arrested, shall be committed
by the sheriff to the jail of the county, and kept in custody
until discharged by law.
SEC. 155. The defendant may, before or after giving
bail, deposit in the hands of the sheriff, or in court, the amount of
money mentioned in the order of arrest; whereupon he shall be dis
charged, or his bail, if any be given, shall be released.
SEC. 156. The sheriff shall pay into court the money
x . ,' 1° i . . T i> i -i -rf • i • r J ,- i i 11 -i
received by him in lieu 01 bail. It received in vacation, he shall pay it
in on the first day of the next term; if received during a term, he shall
pay it in immediately.
SEC. 157. The court shall make proper orders for the
safe keeping of money deposited in lieu of bail. It may direct the sheriff
to keep the money, and, after final judgment in the action, shall order it
to be paid to the party entitled thereto, according to the result.
SEC. 158. Money so deposited with the sheriff, in lieu
of bail, or directed by the court to be kept by him, shall be held upon
his official responsibility ; and he and his sureties shall be liable, and may
be proceeded against for any default in relation thereto, as in other cases
of delinquency.
SEC. 159. Bail may be given by the defendant on his
arrest, or at any time afterward, before judgment. It shall be done by
causing one or more sufficient sureties to execute a written undertaking
to the plaintiff, in the presence of the sheriff, to the effect that, if -°"J~
ment shall be rendered in the action against the defendant, he will render
himself amenable to the process of the court thereon. The undertak
ing, when accepted, shall be returned to the clerk's office, and the defend
ant discharged.
SEC. 160. The plaintiff or his attorney may accept the
bail by indorsing such acceptance on the undertaking; or may object to
the bail, for insufficiency, at any time within five days after the under
taking has been given. Within such time, he shall serve upon the sheriff
a written notice that he does not accept the bail, or he shall be deemed
to have accepted it, and the sheriff shall be exonerated from liability.
When the undertaking is given after return of arrest, the plaintiff shall
have notice thereof.
SEC. 161. On the receipt of such notice, the sheriff or
defendant may, within two days thereafter, give, to the plaintiff or his
attorney, notice, in writing, of the justification of the same or other
bail, before a judge or clerk of the court in which the action is brought,
a probate judge or justice of the peace, at a specified time and place; the
j>-
time to be not less than five nor more than ten days thereafter. In ease
other bail be given, there must be a new undertaking.
SEC. 162' For tlie PurPose of justification, eachof the
bail must attend before the proper officer, at the time and place mentioned,
and may be examined on oath or affirmation touching his sufficiency, in
such manner as the officer may think proper.
SEC. 163. If the officer find the bail sufficient, he shall
indorse his allowance on the undertaking, and cause the same to be filed
with the clerk, and the sheriff shall thereupon be discharged from lia
bility,
SEC. 164. After being arrested, if the defendant escapes
or be rescued, or bail be not taken, or be adjudged insufficient, or a
deposit be not made, the sheriff shall be liable as bail. But he may
discharge himself from liability by putting in sufficient bail at any
time before judgment.
SEC. 165. The return of " Not found," upon an execu-
against the body of the defendant, shall be necessary to fix the
liability of the sheriff as bail, which liability shall be the amount of the
judgment, interest and costs. This liability shall be enforced only in a
separate action against him, or against him and his sureties on his official
bond, as in other cases of delinquency.
SEC. 166. The bail adjudged insufficient, shall be liable
to the sheriff for the damages he may sustain by reason of such insuffi
ciency.
SEC. 167. The liability of the bail shall be fixed in
the manner provided in section one hundred and sixty-five, for fixing
the liability of the sheriff as bail, and the bail can be proceeded against
in an action only.
SEC. 168. A surrender of the defendant to the sheriff
of the county in which he was arrested, with a delivery of a certified
copy of the undertaking of the bail, whether such surrender be made by
the defendant himself, or by his bail, shall discharge the bail. Such sur
render may be made at any time before the return day of the summons
in an action against the bail. The sheriff shall give to the bail a written
acknowledgment of the surrender, and hold the defendant in his cus
tody, upon said copy of the undertaking of the bail, as upon an order
of arrest. On the production of the sheriff's acknowledgment of the
surrender, to the clerk of the court, an exoneration of the bail shall be
entered on his undertaking.
SEC. 169. For the purpose of surrendering the defend-
ant, the bail, at any time or place, before he is finally charged, may
himself arrest him, or by a written authority, indorsed on a certified
copy of the undertaking, may empower any person of suitable age and
discretion to do so.
SEC. 170. The bail will be exonerated by the death of
^e Defendant, or his imprisonment in a state prison, or by his legal dis
charge from the obligation to surrender himself amenable to the process
of the court, or by his surrender to the sheriff of the county in which
he was arrested in execution thereof, within the time fixed in section
one hundred and sixty-eight, or within such further time as the court,
in which the action is pending, may allow.
SEC. 171. If money be deposited by the defendant on
his discharge, bail may be given and justified, upon notice as prescribed
in section one hundred and sixty-one, at any time before judgment; and
thereupon the court in which the action is brought, on being satisfied
that the bail has been given and adjudged sufficient, shall direct that the
money deposited be refunded to the defendant, and it must be refunded
accordingly.
SEC. 172. If, at any time before or after judgment
against the bail, proceedings in error are commenced, on the judgment
against the principal, in the suit in which their undertaking was taken,
the court may, on motion, stay proceedings against such bail, for a rea-
sonable time, on their paying all the costs that have accrued against
them; and if, on such proceedings, the judgment against the principal
shall be reversed, and the principal discharged from said suit, the bail
shall be discharged from the undertaking.
SEC. 173. A defendant may, at any time before judgment,
apply on motion to the court in which the suit is brought, if in
session, and in vacation to a judge thereof, to vacate the order of arrest,
or to reduce the amount of bail. Reasonable notice of such motion
, i • , 11 i • ,-af
must be given to the plaintiff.
SEC. 174. If the motion be made upon affidavits on
the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose
the same, by affidavits or other evidence, in addition to that on which
the order of arrest was made.
SEC. 175. Any person causing another to be com-
mitted to jail, under the provisions of this article, shall be liable, in the
first instance, for the jail fees, and shall, if required by the jailor, pay
such fees weekly, in advance; and such fees, so paid, shall be a part of
the costs of the case.

ject of litigation, is held by him as trustee for another party, or which
belongs or is due to another party, the court may order the same to be
deposited in court or delivered to such party, with or without security,
subject to the further direction of the court.
SEC. 260. Whenever, in the exercise of its authority,
a court shall have ordered the deposit or delivery of money or other

thereof be tried by the court; and any petit juror who shall be returned
upon the trial of any of the causes hereinbefore specified, against whom4rl;
no principal cause of challenge can be alleged, may, nevertheless, be J

any other cause that may render him, at the time, an unsuitable juror;
and the validity of such challenge shall be determined by the court.

v. Home, li Kas. 1:' ";; The State v. Medlicott, 9 Kas. -/,'. See, also, note to article 11,
SEC. 271. The plaintiff first, and afterward the defendant,
shall complete his challenges for cause. They may then, in turn, in
the same order, have the right to challenge one juror each, until each
shall have peremptorily challenged three jurors, but no more.
SEC. 272. After each challenge, the vacancy shall be
filled before further challenges are made; and any new juror thus intro
duced may be challenged for cause as well as peremptorily.
SEC. 273. When the requisite number of jurors cannot
otherwise be obtained, the sheriff shall select talesmen to supply the deficiency
from the bystanders, or the body, of the county, as the court may
direct.
SEC. 274. The jury shall be sworn to well and truly
try the matters submitted to them in the case in hearing, and a true
verdict give, according to the law and the evidence.
SEC. 275. When the jury has been sworn, the trial
shall proceed in. the following order, unless the court for special reasons,
otherwise direct. First, The party on whom rests the burthen of the
issues, may briefly state his case and the evidence by which he expects
to sustain it. Second, The adverse party may then briefly state hisi
defense, and the evidence he expects to offer in support of it. Third,
The party on whom rests the burthen of the issues, must first produce
his evidence; after he has closed his evidence, the adverse party may
interpose and file a demurrer thereto, upon the ground that no cause
of action or defense is proved. If the court shall sustain the demurrer,
such judgment shall be rendered for the party demurring, as the state of
the pleadings, or the proof, shall demand; if the demurrer be overruled,
the adverse party will then produce his evidence. Fourth, The parties
will then be confined to rebutting evidence, unless the court, for good
reason, in furtherance of justice, permits them to offer evidence in their
original case. Fifth, When the evidence is concluded, and either party
desires special instructions to be given to the jury, such instructions
shall be reduced to writing, numbered and signed by the party, or his
attorney, asking the same, and delivered to the court. Sixth, When the
•
argument of the case is concluded, the court shall give general instruc-
tions to the jury, which shall be in writing, and be numbered and signed
by the judge, if required by either party. Seventh^ When either party
^ks special instructions to be given to the jury, the court shall either
£*ve sucn inductions as requested, or positively refuse to do so; or give
the instructions with a modification, in such manner that it shall dis
tinctly appear what instructions were given, in whole or part, and in
like manner those refused, so that either party may except to the
instructions, as asked for, or as modified, or to the modification; all
instructions given by the court must be signed by the judge, and filed
together with those asked for by the parties, as a part of the record.
SEC. 276. A party excepting to the giving of instructions,
or the refusal thereof, shall not be required to nle a formal bill of
exceptions; but it shall be sufficient to write at the close of each instruction,
" Refused and excepted to," or, " Given and excepted to," which
shall be signed by the judge.
SEC. 277. Whenever, in the opinion of the court, it is
proper for the jury to have a view of the property which is the subject
of litigation, or of the place in which any material fact occurred, it may
order them to be conducted, in a body, under the charge of an officer, to
the place, which shall be shown to them by some person appointed by
the court for that purpose. While the jury are thus absent, no person,
other than the person so appointed, shall speak to them on any subject
connected with the trial.
SEC. 278. When the case is finally submitted to the
jury, they may decide in court or retire for deliberation. If they retire.
they must be kept together, in some convenient place, under charge of
an officer, until they agree upon a verdict or be discharged by the court,
subject to the discretion of the court to permit them to separate tempo
rar*ly a* night, and a* ^eir meals. The officer having them under his
charge shall not suffer any communication to be made to them, or make
any himself, except to ask them if they are agreed upon their verdict,
unless by order of the court; and he shall not, before their verdict is
rendered, communicate to any person the state of their deliberations, or
the verdict agreed upon.
SEC. 279. If the jury are permitted to separate, either
during the trial or after the case is submitted to them, they shall be
admonished by the court that it is their duty not to converse with, or
suffer themselves to be addressed by, any other person, on any subject of
the trial, and that it is their duty not to form or express an opinion
thereon, until the case is finally submitted to them.
SEC. 280. After the jury have retired for deliberation,
if there be a disagreement between them as to any part of the testimony,
or if they desire to be informed as to any part of the law arising in the
case, they may request the officer to conduct them to the court, where
^ informa|;iOI1 on the point of law shall be given in writing, and the
court may give its recollection as to the testimony on the point in dis
pute, in the presence of, or after notice to, the parties or their counsel.
SEC. 281. The jury may be discharged by the court on
account of fag sickness of a juror, or other action or calamity requiring
their discharge, or by consent of both parties, or after they have been
kept together until it satisfactorily appears that there is no probability
of their agreeing.
SEC. 282. In all cases where the jury are discharged
during the trial, or after the cause is submitted to them, it may be tned
again immediately, or at a future time, as the court may direct.
SEC. 283. When the jury have agreed upon their vermust
^e conducted into court, their names called by the clerk,
and the verdict rendered by their foreman. When the verdict is
announced, either party may require the jury to be polled, which is done
by the clerk or the court asking each juror if it is his verdict. If any
one answers in the negative, the jury must again be sent out, for further
deliberation.
SEC. 284. The verdict shall be written, signed by the
foreman and read by the clerk to the jury, and the inquiry made whether
it is their verdict. If any juror disagrees, the jury must be sent put
again; but if no disagreement be expressed, and neither party requires
the jury to be polled, the verdict is complete, and the jury discharged
from the case. If, however, the verdict be defective in form only, the
same may, with the assent of the jury, before they are discharged, be
corrected by the court.
VERDICT.
SEC. 285. The verdict of a jury is either general or
special. A general verdict is that by which they pronounce generally d
upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of the plaintiff or defendant.
A special verdict is that by which the jury finds facts only. Itp
must present the facts as established by the evidence, and not the evidence
to prove them; and they must be so presented as that nothinggat
remains to the court but to draw from them conclusions of law.
SEC. 7. In all cases the jury shall render a d
general verdict, and the court shall in any case at the request of the
parties thereto, or either of them, in addition to the general verdict, ^
direct the jury to find upon particular questions of fact, to be stated in A
writing by the party or parties requesting the same.

SEC. 287. When the special finding of facts is inconsistent
with the general verdict, the former controls the latter, and the
court may give judgment accordingly.
SEC. 288. When, by the verdict, either party is entitled
to recover money of the adverse party, the jury, in their verdict, must
assess the amount of the recovery.
TRIAL BY THE COURT.
SEC. 289. The trial by jury may be waived by the
parties, ia actions arising on contract, and with the assent of the court
in other actions, in the following manner: By the consent of the party
appearing, when the other party fails to appear at the trial by himself or
attorney. By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed with the
clerk. By oral consent, in open court, entered on the journal.
SEC. 290. Upon the trial of questions of fact by the
court, it shall not be necessary for the court to state its finding, except
generally, for the plaintiff or defendant, unless one of the parties request
it, with the view of excepting to the decision of the court upon the
questions of law involved in the trial; in which case the court shall
state, in writing, the conclusions of fact found, separately from the con-
dusions of law.

SEC. 292. When the parties do not consent, the court
may, upon the application of either, or of its own motion, direct a refer-
ence in either of the following cases: Where the trial of an issue of fact

is on one side only, and it shall he made to appear to the court that it is
necessary tna(; the party on the other side should be examined as a witness
to prove the account; in which case the referees may be directed to
hear and report upon the whole issue, or upon any specific question of
fact involved therein; or where the taking of an account shall be neces
sary for the information of the court before judgment, in cases which
may be determined by the court, or for carrying a judgment into effect;
or where a question of fact other than upon the pleadings shall arise,
upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of an action.
SEC. 293. A trial before referees is conducted in the
same manner as a trial by the court. They have the same power to
summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses, to administer allnecessarv
oaths in the trial of the case, and to grant adjournments, as the
court, upon such trial. They must state the facts found and the conelusions
of law separately, and their decisions must be given, and may
^e exceP';e<i ^° and reviewed in like manner. The report of the referees
upon the whole issue stands as the decision of the court, and judgment
mav be entered thereon in the same manner as if the action had been
tried by the court. When the referee is to report the facts, the report
has the eifect of a special verdict.

refer, and shall be filed with the clerk of the court, with the other papers
in the case,

the process, return, the pleadings subsequent thereto, reports, ver-
diets, orders, judgments, and all material acts and proceedings of the

SEC. 443. Lands, tenements, goods and chattels, not
exempt by law, shall be subject to the payment of debts, and shall be
liable to be taken on execution and sold, as hereinafter provided.
SEC. 444- A11 real estate, not bound by the lien of the
judgment, as well as goods and chattels of the debtor, shall be bound
from the time they shall be seized in execution.
SEC. 445. If execution shall not be sued out within
five years from the date of any judgment that now is or may hereafter
^e rendered, in any court of record in this state, or if five years shall
have intervened between the date of the last execution issued on such
judgment and the time of suing out another writ of execution thereon,
such judgment shall become dormant, and shall cease to operate as a lien
on the estate of the judgment debtor.
SEC. 446. The writ of execution against the property
of the judgment debtor, issuing from any court of record in this state,
shall command the officer to wliom it is directed, that of the eoods and
chattels of the debtor he cause to be made the money specified in the
writ; and for want of goods and chattels, he cause the same to be made
of the lands and tenements of the debtor; and the amount of the debt,
damages and costs, for which the judgment is entered, shall be indorsed
on the execution.
SEC. 447. When two or more writs of execution against
the same debtor shall be sued out during the term in which judgment
was rendered, or within ten days thereafter, and when two or more writs
of execution against the same debtor shall be delivered to the officer on
the same day, no preference shall be given to either of such writs; but
if a sufficient sum of money be not made to satisfy all [such] executions,
the amount made shall be distributed to the several creditors, in propor
tion to the amount of their respective demands. In all other cases, the
writ of execution first delivered to the officer shall be first satisfied. And
it shall be the duty of the officer to indorse on every writ of execution
the time when he received the same; but nothing herein contained shall
be so construed as to affect any preferable lien which one or more of
the judgments, on which execution issued, may have on the lands of the
judgment debtor.
SEC. 448. The officer to whom a writ of execution is
delivered, shall proceed immediately to levy the same upon the goods and
chattels of the debtor; but if no goods and chattels can be found, the
officer shall indorse on the writ of execution " No goods," and forthwith

which may be liable, to satisfy the judgment.
SEC. 449. If the officer, by virtue of an execution
issued from any court of record in this state, shall levy the same on any
goods and chattels claimed by any person other than the defendant, or
be requested by the plaintiff to levy on any such goods and chattels, the
officer may require the plaintiff to give him an undertaking, with good
and sufficient securities, to pay all costs and damages that he may sustain
by reason of the detention or sale of such property; and until such undertaking
shall be given, the officer may refuse to proceed as against such
property.
SEC. 450. In all cases where a sheriff, coroner or other
officer shall, by virtue of an execution, levy upon any goods and chattels
which shall remain upon his hands unsold, for want of bidders, for
the want of time to advertise and sell, or any other reasonable cause, the
officer may, for his own security, take of the defendant an undertaking,
with security, in such sum as he may deem sufficient, to the effect that
the said property shall be delivered to the officer holding an execution,
for the sale of the same, at the time and place appointed by said officer,
either by notice, given in writing, to said defendant in execution, or by
advertisement, published in a newspaper printed in the count}', naming
therein the day and place of sale. If the defendant shall fail to deliver
the goods and chattels at the time and place mentioned in the notice to
him given, or to pay to the officer holding the execution the full value
of said goods and chattels, or the amount of said debt and costs, the
undertaking, given as aforesaid, may be proceeded on as in other cases.
SEC. 451. The officer who levies upon goods and chat-
tels, by virtue of an execution issued by a court of record, before he
proceeds to sell the same shall cause public notice to be given of the
time and place of sale, for at least ten days before the day of sale. The
notice shall be given by advertisement, published in some newspaper
printed in the county, or, in case no newspaper be printed therein, by
setting up advertisements in five public places in the county. Two ad
vertisements shall be put up in the township where the sale is to be

sale of property previously taken in execution, the officer issuing said
•writ shall, at the request of the person entitled to the benefit thereof,
his agent or attorney, add thereto a command to the officer to whom
such writ shall be directed, that if the property remaining in his hands
not sold shall, in his opinion, be insufficient to satisfy the judgment, he
shall levy the same upon lands and tenements, goods and chattels, or
either, as the law shall permit, being the property of the judgment
debtor, sufficient to satisfy the debt.

SEC. 459. The sheriff or other officer who, upon such
^^ or wr^.g Of executioni snan sell the said lands and tenements, or
any part thereof, shall make to the purchaser as good and sufficient deed
of conveyance of the lands and tenements sold, as the person or persons
against whom such writ or writs of execution were issued could
have made of the same at, or any time after they became liable to the
judgment. The deed shall be sufficient evidence of the legality of suchM
sale, and the proceedings therein, until the contrary be proved, and
shall vest in the purchaser as good and as perfect an estate in the premises
therein mentioned as was vested in the party at, or afte'r, the time when,
such lands and tenements became liable to the satisfaction of the judg
ment; and such deed of conveyance, to be made by the sheriff or other
officer, shall recite the execution or executions, or the substance there
of, and the names of the parties, the amount and date of rendition of
each judgment, by virtue whereof the said lands and tenements were
sold as aforesaid, and shall be executed, acknowledged and recorded as

judgment creditors, in whose favor one or more of said executions are

so many thereof as may be required, on separate parcels of the real prop
erty of the judgment debtor or debtors, giving to the officer making the
levy on behalf of the creditor, whose execution may, by the provisions
of this article, be entitled to a preference, the choice of such part of the
real property of the judgment debtor or debtors, as will be sufficient, at
two-thirds of the appraised value, to satisfy the same; and in all cases
where two or more executions, which are entitled to no preference over
each other, are put into the hands of the same officer, it shall be the
duty of the officer, when required, to levy the same on separate parcels
of the real property of the judgment debtor or debtors, when, in the
opinion of the appraisers, the same may be divided without material
injury; and if the real property of said debtors will not be sufficient, at
two-thirds of its appraised value, to satisfy all the executions chargeable
thereon, such part of the same shall be levied on, to satisfy each execu
tion, as will bear the same proportion in value to the whole, as the
amount due to the execution bears to the amount of all the executions
chargeable thereon, as near as may be, according to the appraised value
of each separate parcel of said real property.
SEC. 465. If the term of service of the sheriff or other
•officer who has made, or shall hereafter make sale of any lands and tene-
ments, shall expire, or if the sheriff or other officer shall be .absent, or
^>e rendered uruible, by death or otherwise, to make a deed of convey-
ance of the same, any succeeding sheriff or other officer, on receiving a
certificate from the court from which execution issued for the sale of
g^j iau(js an(j tenements, signed by the clerk, by order of said court,
setting forth that sufficient proof h;is been made to the court that such
sale was fairly and legally made; and on tender of the purchase money.
or if the same or any part thereof be paid, then, on proof of such pay
ment and tender of the balance, if any, may execute to the said pur
chaser or purchasers, or his or their legal representatives, a deed of
conveyance of said lands and tenements so sold. Such deed shall be as
good and valid in law, and have the same effect, as if the sheriff or other
officer who made the sale had executed the same.
SEC. 46G. If, on any sale made as aforesaid, there shall
^e in jne hands of the sheriff or other officer, more money than is suffi

defendant in execution, or his legal representatives.
SEC. 461. If any judgment or judgments, in satisfac-
,.v r Y • -i t i L 111111. it.
tion of which any lands or tenements are sold, shall at any time tnerear>^er
be reversed, such reversal shall not defeat or affect the title of the
purchaser or purchasers; but, in such cases, restitution shall be made, by
the judgment creditors, of the money, for which such lands or tene
ments were sold, with lawful interest from the day of sale.
SEC. 468. No judgment heretofore rendered, or which
hereafter may be rendered, on which execution shall not have been taken
ou* an(l levied before the expiration of one year next after its rendition,
shall operate as a lien on the estate of any debtor, to the prejudice of
any other judgment creditor. But in all cases where judgment has
been or may be rendered in the supreme court, and a special mandate
awarded to the district court to carry the same into execution, the lien
of the judgment creditor shall continue for one year after the first day of
the term of the district court to which such mandate may be directed.
Nothing in this section contained shall be construed to defeat the lien of
any judgment creditor who shall fail to take out execution and cause a
levy to be made, as herein provided, when such failure shall be occasioned
by appeal, proceedings in error, injunction, or by vacancy in the office of
sheriff or coroner, or the disability of such officer, until one year after
such disability shall be removed. In all cases where real estate has been
or may hereafter be taken on execution and appraised, and twice adver
tised and offered for sale, and shall remain unsold for want of bidders, it
shall be the duty of the court from which such execution issued, on
motion of the plaintiff, to set aside such appraisement and order a new
one to be made, or to set aside such levy and appraisement and award a
new execution to issue, as the case may require.

any court of record within this state, upon any instrument of writing
in which two or more persons are jointly and severally bound, and it
shall be made to appear to the court, by parol or other testimony, that

for his or their co-defendant, it shall be the duty of the clerk of said
court, in recording the judgment thereon, to certify which of the defendantg
ig principal debtor, and which are sureties or bail. And the clerk
of the court aforesaid shall issue execution on such judgment, com
manding the sheriff or other officer to cause the money to be made of
the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of the principal debtor; but
for want of sufficient property of the principal debtor to make the same,
that he cause the same to be made of the goods and chattels, lands and
tenements, of the surety or bail. In all cases, the property, both per
sonal and real, of the principal debtor, within the jurisdiction of the
court, shall be exhausted before any of the property of the surety or
bail shall be taken in execution.

making the return of such appraisement. And when any householder,
summoned as aforesaid, shall fail to appear at the time or place appointed
by the officer, and discharge his duty as appraiser, he shall, 011 complaint
being made to any justice of the peace of the township in which such

use of the township.

any writ of execution to the proper court, on or before the return day

amount of the debt, damages and costs; or shall refuse or neglect, on
demand, to pay over to the plaintiff, his agent or attorney of record,
all mone3rs by him collected or received for the use of said party, at
any time after collecting or receiving the same, except as provided in section four hundred and fifty-eight; or shall neglect or refuse, on.
demand made by the defendant, his agent or attorney of record, to pay
over all moneys by him received for any sale made, beyond what is
sufficient to satisfy the writ or writs of execution, with interest and
legal costs, such sheriff or other officer shall, on motion in court, and

omcer shall not be amerced in a greater sum than the amount so with
held, with ten per cent, thereon.

of any county other than that in which the judgment was rendered, the
sheriff, after indorsing the date of its reception thereon, shall deliver the
same to the clerk of the district court of his county, who shall thereupon
enter the same in the execution docket in the same manner as if it had
issued from the court of which he is clerk; and before the sheriff shall
return any such writ, he shall cause his return to ba entered in like
manner.
SEC. 476. When execution shall be issued in any
county in this state, and directed to the sheriff or coroner of another
county, it shall be lawful for such sheriff or coroner having the execu-
tion, after having discharged all the duties required of him by law, to
inclose such execution, by mail, to the clerk of the court who issued the
same. On proof being made by such sheriif or coroner, that the execu

issued within the time prescribed by law, the sheriff or coroner shall not
be liable for any amercement or penalty if it do not reach the office in
due time.

prosecuted as in other cases; but the goods and chattels, lands and ten
ements of any such surety shall not be liable to be taken on execution,
when sufficient goods and chattels, lands and tenements of tlie sheriff
or other officer, against whom execution may be issued, can be found to
satisfy the same. Nothing herein contained shall prevent either party
from proceeding against such sheriff or other officer, by attachment, at
his election.
SEC. 479. In cases where a sheriff or other officer may
be amerced, and shall not have collected the amount of the original
judgment, he shall be permitted to sue out an -execution and collect the
amount of said judgment, in the name of the original plaintiff, for his
use.
SEC. 480. When property, liable to an execution
against several persons, is sold thereon, and more than a due proportion

them pays, without a sale, more than his proportion, he may compel
contribution from the others; and when a judgment is against several,
and is upon an obligation of one of them, as security for another, and
the surety pays the amount, or any part thereof, either by sale of
his property or before sale, he may compel repayment from, the princi
pal; in such case, the person so paying or contributing is entitled to the
benefit of the judgment, to enforce contribution or repayment, if within

fied, in whole or in part, the judgment creditor is entitled to an order of
the probate judge, or judge of the district court, of the county to which

otherwise, that there is danger of the debtor leaving the state, or cou-«d
cealing himself, to avoid the examination herein mentioned, issue a
•warrant requiring the sheriff to arrest him and bring him before such
judge, within the county in which the debtor may be arrested. Such a

person or persons holding such legal estate or interest therein, or hen

SEC. 690. The writ is either alternative or peremptory.
The alternative writ must state, concisely, the facts, showing the
obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and his omission to per
form it, and command him that immediately upon receipt of the writ,
or at some other specified time, he do the act required to be performed or
show cause before the court whence the writ issued, at a specified time
and place, why he has not done so; and that he then and there return
the writ with his certificate of having done as he is commanded. The
peremptory writ must be in a similar form, except that the words requir
ing the defendant to show cause why he has not done as commanded,
must be omitted.
SEC. 691. When the right to require the performance
of the act is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be given for
not performing it, a peremptory mandamus may be allowed in the first
instance; in all other cases, the alternative writ must be first issued.
SEC. 692. The motion for the writ must be made upon
affidavit, and the court may require a notice of the application to be
given to the adverse party, or may grant an order to show cause why it
should not be allowed, or may grant the writ without notice.
SEC. 693. The allowance of the writ must be indorsed
thereon, signed by the judge of the court granting it, and the writ
must be served personally upon the defendant; if the defendant, duly
served, neglect to return the same, he shall be proceeded against, as for
a contempt.
SEC. 694. On the return day of the alternative writ, or
such further day as the court may allow, the party on whom the writ
shall have been served may show cause, by answer made in the same
manner as an answer to a petition in a civil action.
SEC. 695. If no answer be made, a peremptory man
damus must be allowed against the defendant; if answer be made, contain-
ing new matter, the same shall not, in any respect, conclude the plaint
iff, who may, on the trial or other proceeding, avail himself of any
valid objections to [its] sufficiency, or may countervail it by proof, either
in direct denial or by way of avoidance.
SEC. 696. No other pleading or written allegation jg
allowed than the writ and answer; these are the pleadings in the case,
and have the same effect, and are to be construed and may be amended
in the same manner, as pleadings in a civil action; and the issues thereby
joined must be tried, and the further proceedings thereon had, in the
same manner as in a civil action.
SEC. 697. If judgment be given for the plaintiff, he
shall recover the damages which he shall have sustained, to be ascertained
by the court or jury, or by referees, as in a civil action, and costs;
and a peremptory mandamus shall also be granted to him without delay.
SEC. 698. A recovery of damages, by virtue of this article, against a party who shall have made a return to a writ of man
damus, is a bar to any other action against the same party for the making
of such return. '
SEC. 699. Whenever a peremptory mandamus is
directed to any public officer, body or board, commanding the perform-
ance of any public duty specially enjoined by law, if it appear to the
court that such officer, or any member of such body or board, has, with
out just excuse, refused or neglected to perform the duty so enjoined, the
court may impose a fine, not exceeding five hundred dollars, upon every
such officer or member of such body or board. Such fine, when col
lected, shall be paid into the treasury of the county where the duty ought
to have been performed; and the payment thereof is a bar to an action
for any penalty incurred by such officer or member of such body or
board, by reason of his refusal or neglect to perform the duty so enjoined.

credits of every kind, of the defendant in the possession of the garnishee,
and for what shall appear to be pwino- by him to the defendant, and for
the costs of the proceedings against the garnishee. If the plaintiff pro
ceed against the garnishee oy action, for the cause that his disclosure was
unsatisfactory, unless it appears in the action that such disclosure was
incomplete, the plaintiff shall pay the costs of such action. The judg
ment in this action may be enforced as judgments in other cases. When
the claims of the plaintiffs in attachment are satisfied by the garnishee,
he may. on motion, be substituted as the plaintiff in the judgment.
SEC. 44. The plaintiff may give notice to the justice that
the answer of the garnishee is unsatisfactory, and demand a trial of the
truth of such answer, and the justice shall thereupon appoint a day for
such trial, which shall be conducted, in all respects, as in other cases.

ment, and the garnishee shall deliver up all property, moneys and cred
its of the defendant in his possession, and pay all the moneys from him
due, as the court may order, the garnishee shall be discharged, and the
costs of the proceedings against him shall be paid out of the property
and moneys so surrendered, or as the court may think right and proper.
SEC. 46. If judgment be rendered, in the action, for the
defendant, the attachment shall be discharged, and the property

SEC. 47. If judgment be rendered for the plaintiff, it shall

of the officers, after applying the moneys arising from the sale of perish
able property, and so much of the personal property, if any, as may be

under the same restrictions and regulations as if the same ha_d been
levied on by execution; and the money arising therefrom, with the
amount which may be recovered from the garnishee, shall be applied to
satisfy the judgment and costs. If there be not enough to satisfy the
same, the judgment shall stand, and execution may issue thereon for the
residue, in all respects as in other cases. Any surplus of the attached
property, or its proceeds, shall be returned to the defendant.
SEC. 48. The justice may order the constable to repossess
himself, for the purpose of selling it, of any of the attached property

attachment.

hands, or due from him to the defendant, from the time he is served with
the written notice mentioned in section thirty-seven ; but when property

approved by the justice, in double the amount of the plaintiff's claim, to
be "stated in his affidavit, to the effect that the defendant shall perform
the judgment of the justice, the attachment in such action shall be dis
charged, and restitution made of any property taken under it, or the
proceeds thereof. Such undertaking shall also discharge the liability of
a garnishee, in such action, for any property of the defendant in his
hands.
SEC. 53. If the defendant shall, before the trial is com-
file an affidavit, denying the grounds laid for the attachment in
the plaintiff's affidavit, the justice shall, on reasonable notice, in writ-
ing, being given to the opposite party, proceed to examine into the
truth of the grounds laid for such attachment, and shall hear such evi
dence as may be produced by either party; and if it appear that such
grounds are not sustained by the evidence, the justice shall discharge
the attachment.
SEC. 54. If, in any case where an order of attachment
nas ^een issued by a justice of the peace, it shall appear from the return

ing shall, at the request of the plaintiff, forthwith certify his proceed
ings to the district court of the proper county; and thereupon the clerk
of said court shall docket said cause, and the action shall be proceeded
with in said court in all respects as if the same had originated therein.
