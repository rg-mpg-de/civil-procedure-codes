the judgment against said defendant or defendants in said attachment. And if any plaintiff shall discontinue his suit by attachment,
or be non-suited, or have a verdict against him on the trial in said
suit, then said judgment against said garnishee shall become null
and void, and such garnishee may have execution for his costs, to
be taxed as in other cases against said plaintiff in said attachment
suit. (in)

under any writ of attachment, said writ may be served by service of
summons of garnishment, on any person or persons owing the de-;
fendant, or having any moneys, goods, chattels, or effects of said
defendant in his or her hands, and such service shall be sufficient
to authorize the plaintiff to proceed in his suit against such defendant, as if said writ of attachment had been levied on any property
of said defendant; but if said plaintiff shall fail to obtain judgment
against any such garnishee, then no judgment shall be rendered
against such defendant in attachment, and if judgment shall have
been rendered against him, then the same shall be cancelled. (92)

dants, shall claim the effects in the hands or possession of any gar-1
nisliee, and shall make affidavit that the said effects are bomnfide:
his or her property, the Court shall immediately, and without the:
formality of pleading, direct a jury to be empannelled, to inquire
of the right of such property, between such claimant and the plaintiff, unless good cause be shown to the contrary; and if the finding
of the jury shall be against such claimant, the plaintiff shall recover
costs; and if the jury find in favor of such claimant, he, she, or
they shall recover costs against the plaintiff, and if such claim be
interposed after a levy on said property, and affidavit is made as
aforesa1d,.then said sheriff or other officer making said levy, shall
return said execution with his levy thereon, and said aflidavit of
said claimant to the clerk’s oflice from which said execution issued,
or to the Justice of the Peace who may issue said execution, and
such proceeding shall be had thereon as in other cases of claims
made to property taken in execution. (0)

service of a copy of such order to appear and answer, or of notice
thereof in writing, sixty days before the time therein limited for

complainants or petitioners, are clearly established to the satisfaction of the Court, or are undisputed, and also, when the rights and
interests of some of the defendants, but not all of them, are ascertained or established, to the satisfaction of the Court, or are
undisputed, the Court may by decree, order partition to be made,
and the shares, proportions, or interests, of the complainant, or
complainants, and such of the defendants as have established and

shall reside, when such cause of action accrued, or by other
indirect ways and means, defeat or obstruct any person or persons
who have title thereto, from bringing or maintaining all, or any of

I

1. If any suit which hath been or shall be hereafter commenced
for relief in equity in any Court against any defendant or defendants who are residing out of this State, and others within the same,
having in their hands effects of, or being otherwise indebted to
such absent defendant or defendants, or against any such absent
defendant or defendants having lands or tenements within the State,
and the appearance of such absentees be not entered and security
given to the satisfaction of the Court for performing the decrees,
upon affidavit that such defendant or defendants are out of the
State, or that upon inquiry at his, her, or their usual place of
abode, he, she, or they could not be found, so as to be served with
process, in all such cases such Court may make any order, and require surety, if it shall appear necessary, to restrain the defendants
in this State from paying or conveying away, or secreting the debts

by them owing to, or the effects in their hands, of such absent defendant or defendants; and for that purpose may order such _debts
to be paid, and effects to be delivered up to the said plaintiff or
plaintiffs, upon their giving sufficient security for the return thereof, to such person and in such manner as the Court shall direct. _(t)

2. The Court shall also appoint some day in the succeeding
term for the absent defendant or defendants to enter his, _her, or
their appearance to the suit, and give security. for performing the
decree, a copy of which order shall by direction of the Court be
forthwith published in any newspaper within this State, the circulation of which shall in the opinion thereof be best calculated to
apprise the absent defendant or defendantsof the pending of such
suit, and continued for two months successively ; and another copy
thereof shall be posted at the front door of such Court-house. _ If
such absent defendant shall not appear, and give such security,
within the time limited, or such further time as the Court may allow, for good cause shown, the Court may proceed to take such
proof as the complainant shall offer; and if they shall thereupon
be satisfied of the justice of the demand, they may order the bill to
be taken as confessed, and make such order or decree thereon,
as shall appear just; and may enforce due performance and execution thereof, by such ways and means as have been heretofore
used for enforcing other decrees, requiring the complainant _or
complainants to give security, as the Court shall approve, for abiding such future orders as may be made for restoring the estate or
effects to the absent defendants, upon his, her, or their appearance
and answering the bill; and if the complainant or complainants
shall refuse to give, or not be able to procure such security, the
elfects shall remain, under the direction of the Court, in the hands
of a receiver, or otherwise, for so long a time, and shall then be
iinally disposed of in such manner as to the Court shall seem
just. 

3. If any~person or persons who shall be out of the State at the
time a decree is pronounced as aforesaid, shall within seven years I
from the passing such decree, return and appear openly; or in case i
of his or her death, if his or her heir, executor or administrator}
shall, with the said seven years, be and appear openly within this
State, the plaintiff or plaintiffs, their executors or administrators,
shall serve such person or persons, so returning and appearing,
with a copy of the decree, within a reasonable time after such return or appearance shall be known to the plaintiff or plaintiffs;
and thereupon such defendant or defendants, or their representatives may, within twelve months after such service, ‘or those defendants not served with a copy, or their representatives, may
within seven years after the decree pronounced, appear in Court,
and petition to have the cause reheard ; and upon their paying
down, or giving security for the payment of such costs as the
Court shall think reasonable, they shall be admitted to answer the

t‘
I;

1.
»e

bill, and issue may be joined, and witnesses on both sides examined,
and such other proceedings, decree, and execution had, as may be
just and right in the cause; but if the several defendants, or their
representatives, upon whom the decree shall be so served, shall not
within twelve months after such service, and the other defendants,
or the representatives, upon whom no such service is made, shall
not within seven years from the time of the decree pronounced, appear and petition to have the cause reheard as aforesaid, and pay,
or secure to be paid, such costs as the Court shall think reasonable,
all and every decree to be made in pursuance of this act against
any defendant or defendants so failing, shall stand absolutely confirmed against him, her, or them; and at the end of such term,
the Court may make such further order for quieting the plaintiff or
plaintiffs in any such suits in their possession, and title to the estate
and effects so sequestered, or made liable, as to them shall seem
reasonable. (22) '

4. In all cases whatever, where a suit is or shall be depending
in any Court, concerning any matter or other thing whatever,
against any absent defendant or defendants, the Court may, on
satisfactory proof to them made, that such defendant or defendants
is, or are out of this State, or that upon inquiry at his, her or their
usual place of abode, he, she, or they could not be found, make
any similar order to that which is directed to be made in the case
of absent debtors, adapting the same to the nature of the case; a
copy of which order shall be published in like manner as is directed
in the case of absent debtors, and thereupon the proceedings in relation to such absent defendant shall be in all respects the same,
both before and after the decree, as are above prescribed in relation
to absent debtors, so far as such proceedings against absent debtors
shall be applicable to such absent defendants. (20)

and that full faith and credit are to be given to all his official acts,
the said blll, petition, or answer in Chancery shall be used in any
Court of law or equity in the same manner as if the same had been

solicitor may file exceptions thereto at any time within three weeks
from the notice of the filing thereof in the clerk’s oihce, and enter

'a rule with the clerk, that the defendant make a better answer
within six weeks, notice of which rule, and of the filing the exception, shall be served upon the defendant or his solicitor ; and if the
defendant shall insist on the sufficiency of his answer, the complainant may set down his exceptions for argument at the next
term ; and if they are sustained, no further or other answer shall
be received but on payment of costs ; and if a second answer put
in be adjudged insufficient, the defendant shall pay double costs;
and the defendant may also, in such case, be examined on interrogatories, and committed till he or she sufiiciently answer them; or

commissions for testimony, and proceed to hearing in the usual
manner. (6)

the practice of the High Court of Chancery in England, and by
the rules of practice for Courts of Equity of the United States,
under the authority of the act of Congress of May 8, 1799. (p)

8. If a plea or demurrer has been overruled, no other plea or
demurrer shall thereafter be received, but the defendant shall
answer the plaintiff’s bill; and if he fail to do so within one calendar month thereafter, the same, or so much thereof as was covered
by the plea or demurrer, may be taken for confessed, and the matter
thereof be decreed accordingly. (g)

give notice thereof to the defendant, or his solicitor, one calendar
month before the second term of the Court after filing the same,
the bill may be dismissed with costs; and the defendant may, in
all cases, instead of filing a formal plea or demurrer, insist on any
