may have. Each must be separately stated and numbered.
and they must refer in an intelligible manner to the cause of
action which they are intended to answer.

SEC. 91. The counter claim, mentioned in the last section,
must be one existing in favor of a defendant and against a
plaintiff, between whom a several judgment might be had in
the action, and arising out of the contract or transaction set
forth in the petition as the foundation of the plaintiff’s claim,
or connected with the subject of the action.

SEC. 92. If the defendant omit to set up the counter
claim or set-off, he cannot recover costs against the plaintiff
on any subsequent action thereon; but this section shall not
apply to causes of action which are stricken out of, or withdrawn from the answer, as provided in sections ninety-three
and one hundred and sixteen.

SEC. 93. When it appears that a new party is necessary
to a final decision upon the counter claim, the court may
either permit the new party to be made by a summons, to
reply to the counter claim, or may direct the counter claim to
be stricken out of the answer, and made the subject of a
separate action.

SEC. 94. A set-off can only be pleaded in an action
founded on contract, and must be a cause of action arising
upon contract, or ascertained by the decision of the court.

SEC. 95. When it appears that a new party is necessary
to a final decision upon the set-off, the court shall permit the
new party to be made, if it also appear that, owing to the insolvency or non-residence of the plaintiff, or other cause, the
defendant will be in danger of losing his claim, unless permitted to use it as a set-off.

SEC. 96. When cross demands have existed between persons under such circumstances, that if one had brought an

action against the other, a counter claim or set-off could have

been set up, neither can be deprived of the benefit thereof, by
the assignment or death of the other, but the two demands
must be deemed compensated, so far ‘as they equal each
other. .

SEC. 97. The guardian of an infant or person of an unsound mind, or attorney for a person in prison, shall deny in
the answer all material allegations of the petition prejudicial
to such defendant.

CHAPTER V. — REPLY.

SEC. 98. There shall be no reply, except upon the allegation of a counter claim or set-off in the answer.

SEC. 99. When the answer contains new matter, constituting a counter claim or set-off, the plaintiff may reply to such
new matter, denying generally or specifically each allegation
controverted by him; and he may allege, in ordinary and concise language and without repetition, any new matter not
inconsistent with the petition, constituting a defence to such
new matter in the answer; or he may demur to the same for
insufficiency, stating in his demurrer the grounds thereof; and
he may demur to one or more of such defences set up in the
answer, and reply to the residue.

CHAPTER VI.—GENE1zAL RULES or PLEADING.

subscribed by the party or his attorney.

SEC. 103. Every pleading of fact must be verified by the
affidavit of the party, his agent or attorney. A pleading verified as herein required shall not be used against a party in
any criminal prosecution or action or proceeding for a penalty

or forfeiture, as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such
pleading; and such verification shall not make other or greater
proof necessary on the side of the adverse party.

SEC. 104. The verification mentioned in the last section]
shall not be required to the answer of a guardian defending
for an infant or person of unsound mind, or a person imprisoned; nor in any,case where the admission of the truth of a
fact stated in the pleading might subject the party to a criminal or penal prosecution.

SEC. 105. If there be several persons united in interest and .
pleading together, ‘the affidavit may be made by any one of ‘
such parties.

SEC. 106. The affidavit shall be sufficient if it state that
the atiiant believes the facts stated in the pleading to be true.

SEC. 107. In all cases where the party pleading is a nonresident of the county in which the action is brought, or if he
shall be absent from the county where the pleading is filed,
an affidavit made before filing the pleading, stating the substance of the facts afterwards inserted in the pleading, shall
be a su$cient verification. Such affidavit shall be filed with
the pleading intended to be verified thereby.

SEC. 108. The affidavit verifying pleadings may be made
before any person before whom a deposition might be taken,
and must be signed by the party making the same; and the
oflicer before whom the same was taken, shall certify that it
was sworn to or atiirmed before him, and signed in his presence. The certificate of such oflicer, signed officially by him,
shall be evidence that the aflidavit was duly made, that the
name of the officer was written by himself, and that he was
such officer.

SEC. 109. The verification of the pleading does not apply
to the amount claimed, except in actions founded on contracts
express or implied, for the payment of money only.

SEC. 110. When the affidavit is made by the agent or
attorney, it must set forth the reason why it is not made by

of the agent or attorney. 2. VV_hen the plaintiff is an infant,
or of unsound mind, or imprisoned. 3. When the pleading
to be verified is founded upon a written instrument for the

SEC. 112. All fictions in pleading are abolished.

SEC. 113. The title of a cause shall not be changed in
any of its stages.

SEC. 114. If the action, counter claim or set-off be founded
on an account, or on a note, bill, or other written instrument, as evidence of indebtedness, a copy thereof must be
attached to and filed with the pleading, excepting in actions
founded upon notes issued to circulate as money. If not so
attached and filed, the reason thereof must be shown in the
pleading.

SEC. 115. If redundant, scandalous, or irrelevant matter
be inserted in any pleading, it may be stricken out on motion
of the party prejudiced thereby. And when the allegations
of a pleading are so indefinite and uncertain that the precise
nature of the charge or defence is not apparent, the court
may require the pleading to be made definite and certain by
amendment.

SEC. 116. The court, at any time before the final submission of the case, on motion of the defendant, may allow a
counter claim or set-off, set up in the answer, to be withdrawn, and the same may become the subject of another
action. On motion of either party, to be made at the time
such counter claim or set-off is withdrawn, an action on the
same shall be docketed and proceeded in as in like cases after
process served; and the court shall direct the time and
manner of pleading therein. If an action be not,so docketed, it may afterwards be commenced in the ordinary way.

SEC. 117. In pleading a judgment or other determination
of a court or ofiicer of special jurisdiction, it shall be sufficient to state that such judgment or determination was duly
given or made. If . such allegation be controverted, the party
pleading must establish, on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction.

SEC. 118. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a contract, it shall be suflicient to state, that the

party duly performed all the conditions on his part; and if
such allegation be controverted, the party pleading must establish, on the trial, the facts showing such performance. '

SEC. 119. In an action, counter claim or set-off, founded
upon an account, promissory note, bill of exchange, or other
instrument, for the unconditional payment of moneyonly, it
shall be sufficient for the party to give a copy of the account
or instrument, with all credits and indorsements thereon, and
to state that there is due to him on such account or instrument, from the adverse party, a specified sum, which he
claims with interest. When others than the makers of a.‘
promissory note, or the acceptors of a bill of exchange, are
parties in the action, it shall be necessary to state also the
kind of liabiity of the several parties, and the facts, as they
may be, which fix their liability.

SEC. 120. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived
therefrom, it shall be sufiicient to refer to such statute by its title and the day of its passage, and the court shall thereupon
take judicial notice thereof.

SEC. 121. In an action for a libel or slander, it shall be
sufiieient to state generally, that the defamatory matter was
published or spoken of the plaintiff, and if the allegation be
denied, the plaintiff must prove on the trial, the facts, showing that the defamatory matter was published or spoken of
him. ‘

SEC. 122. In the actions mentioned in the last section,
the defendant may allege the truth of the matter charged as
defamatory, and may prove the same, and any mitigating circumstanees to reduce the amount of damages, or he may
prove either.

SEC. 123. In an action for the recovery of real property, it,
shall be described with sufficient certainty, as will enable an
officer holding an execution to identify it.

SEC. 124. Every material allegation of the petition not
controverted by the answer, and every material allegation of
new matter in the answer, constituting a counter claim or
set-oh’, not controverted by the reply, shall, for the purposes of
theaction, be taken as true; but the allegation of new matter in the answer, not relating to a counter claim or set-off, or
of new matter in reply, shall be deemed to be controverted
by the adverse party, as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as

the case may require. Allegations of value, or of amount.of
damage, shall not be considered as true, by failure to controvert them.

SEC. 125. A material allegation in a pleading, is one essential to the claim or defence, which could not be stricken
from the pleading, without leaving it insufficient.

SEC. 126. Neither presumptions of law, nor matters of
which judicial notice is taken, need be stated in the pleading.

SEC. 127. If an original pleading be lost, or withheld by
any person, the court may allow a copy thereof to be substituted.

CHAPTER VII.——Mrs'rAx1=:s IN PLEADING AND Ajnzxnura-..\"rs.

SEC. 128. No variance between the allegation in pleading
and the proof, is to be deemed material, unless it have actually
misled the adverse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his
action or defence upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged,
that a party has been so misled, that fact must be proved to
the satisfaction of the court, and it must also be shown in
what respect he has been misled; and thereupon the court

may order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as _

may be just.

SEC. 129. When the variance is not material, as provided
in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be‘ found
according to the evidence, and may order an immediate
amendment without costs.

SEC. 130. When, however, the allegation of the claim or
defence, to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in
some particular, or particulars only, but in its general scope
and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of variance within
the last two sections, but a failure of proof.

SEC. 131. The plaintiff may amend his petition without
leave, at any time before the answer is filed, without prejudice
to the proceeding; but notice of such amendment shall be
served upon.the defendant, or his attorney, and the defendant
shall have the same time to answer or demur thereto, as to
the original petition.

SEC. 132. At any time within ten days after a demurrer
is filed, the adverse party may amend, of course, on payment
of costs since filing the defective pleading. Notice of filing

an amended pleading, shall be forthwith served upon the other
party, who shall have the same time thereafter to answer, or
reply thereto, as to an original pleading.

SEC. 133. Upon a demurrer being overruled, the party

who demurred may answer or reply, if the court be satisfied;

that he has a meritorious claim or defence, and did not demur
for delay.

SEC. 134. The court may, before judgment, in further-4

ance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend
any pleading, process, or proceeding, by adding or striking
out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the
name of a party, or mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case, or when the
amendment does not change substantially the claim or defence, by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts
proved. And whenever any proceeding taken by a party fails
to conform, in any respect, to the provisions of this code, the
court may permit the same to be made conformable thereto,
by amendment.

SEC. 135. The court, in every stage of an action, must
disregard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings,
which does 11ot affect the substantial rights of the adverse
party; and no judgment shall be reversed or affected by
reason of such error or defect.

SEC. 136. If the demurrer bepsustained, the adverse party
may amend, if the defect can be remedied by way of amendment, with or without cost, as the court in its discretion shall
direct.

SEC. 137. When either party shall amend any pleading
or proceeding, and the court shall be satisfied by aliidavit, or
otherwise, that the adverse party could not be ready for trial
in consequence thereof, a continuance may be granted to
some day in term, or to another term of the court.

SEC. 138. When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the
name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in
any pleading or proceeding by any name and description;
and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or pro-_
ceeding may be amended accordingly. The plaintiff in such
case must state, in the verification of his petition, that he
could not discover the true name, and the summons must

contain the words, “real name unknown,” and a copy thereof
must be served personally upon the defendant.
SEC. 139. Either party may be allowed, on notice, and on

such terms as to costs as the court may prescribe, to ‘file a,

supplemental petition, answer, or reply, alleging facts material
to the case, occurring after the former petition, answer or
reply.

SEC. 140. Whenever two or more actions are pending in
the same court, which might have been joined, the defendant
may, on motion and notice to the adverse party, require him
to show cause why the same shall not be consolidated; and
if no such cause be shown, the said several actions shall be
consolidated.

SEC. 141. The order for consolidation may be made by

the court, or by a judge thereof, in vacation.

SEC. 171. The plaintiff in an action to recover the possession of specific personal property, may, at the commencement of the suit, or at any time before answer, claim the

to the same are bound, in double the appraised value thereof,
that the property or its appraised value in money, shall be
forthcoming to answer the judgment of the court in the
action; but if it shall appear to the court that any part of

and credits in his hands, or due from him to the defendant,
from the time he is served with the written notice mentioned
in section one hundred and ninety-seven; but where tire property is attached in the hands of a consignee, his lien thereon
shall not be affected by the attachment.

SEC. 203. The court, or any judge thereof during vacation, may, on the application of the plaintiff, and on good
cause shown, appoint a receiver, who shall take an oath faithfully to discharge his duty, and shall give an undertaking to
the Territory of Dakota, in such sum as the court or judge
may direct, and with such security as shall be approved by
the clerk of the court, for the faithful performance of his duty
as such receiver, and to pay over all money, and account for

proceedings to the court, and hold all moneys collected by
him, and property which may come into his hands, subject to
the order of the court.

SEC. 207. Where a receiver is not appointed by the
court or a judge thereof, as provided in section two hundred
and three, the sheriff or other officer attaching the property

such officer. He may be required to give security, other than
his official undertaking.

SEC. 208. The court shall make proper orders for the
preservation of the property, during the pendency of the suit.

by the judge of the court. The sale shall be public, after
such advertisement as is prescribed for the sale of like property on execution, and 'shall be made in ‘such manner, and
upon such terms of credit, with security, as the court [or]
judge, having regard to the probable duration of the‘ action,
may direct. The proceeds, if collected by the sheriff, with all

the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgment of
the court, the attachment in such action shall be discharged,

by the officer before whom the undertaking is.executed.

SEC. 211. The garnishee shall appear as follows: If the,
order of attachment be returned during a term of court, he‘
shall appear at that term; if the order be returned during
vacation, he shall appear at the term next after its return.

to him touching the property of every description and credits
of the defendant, in his possession or under his control, and

the payment of the amount owing by the garnishee, into the
court; or the court may permit the garnishee to retain the
property or the amount owing, upon the execution of an
undertaking to the plaintiff by one or more sufficient sureties,
to the effect, that the amount shall be paid, dr the property
forthcoming, as the court may direct.

SEC. 215. If the garnishee fail to appear and answer, or
if he appear and answer, and his disclosure is not satisfactory to the plaintiff, or if he fail to comply with the order of
the court, to deliver the property and pay the money owing
into court, or give the undertaking required in the preceding section, the plaintiff may proceed against him in an action,
by filing a petition in his own name, as in other cases, and
causing a summons to be issued upon it; and thereupon such
proceedings may be had as in other actions, and judgment
may be rendered in favor of the plaintiff, for the amount of
the property and credits, of every kind, of the defendant in
the possession of the garnishee, and for what shall appear
to be owing by him to the defendant, and for the costs of the
proceedings against the garnishee. If the plaintiff proceed

of the plaintiffs in attachment are satisfied, the defendant in
attachment may, on motion, be substituted as the plaintiff in
the judgment. A

be paid out of the property and moneys so surrendered, or as
the court may think right and proper.

arising from the sale of perishable property, and so much of
the‘ personal property and lands and tenements, if any, whether
held by legal or equitable title, as may be necessary to satisfy
the judgment, shall be sold by order of the court, under the
same restrictions and regulations as if the same had been
levied on by execution; and the money arising therefrom,
with the amount which may be recovered from the garnishee,
shall be applied to satisfy the judgment and costs. If there
be not enough to satisfy the same, the judgment shall stand,
and the execution may issue thereon for the residue, in all
respects as in other cases. Any surplus of the attached property, or its proceeds, shall be returned to the defendant.

SEC. 219. The court may compel the delivery to the,
sheriff, for sale, of any of the attached property for which an
undertaking may have been given, and may proceed summarily on such undertaking, to enforce the delivery of the property, or the payment of such sum as may be due upon

contempt.

himself, for the purpose of selling it, any of the attached
property which may have passed out of his -hands, without

property as he would have under an order of attachment.

be claimed by any person other than the defendant, it shall
be the duty of the officer to have the validity of such claim
tried, and such proceedings must be had thereon, with the
like effect as in case the property had been seized upon execution, and claimed by a third person.

vthe same property, or the same persons are made garnishees,
the court, on the motion of any of the plaintiffs, may order a
reference to ascertain and report the amounts and priorities of
the several attachments.

SEC. 223. From the time of the issuing of the order of
attachment, the court shall be deemed to have acquired jurisdiction and to have control of all subsequent proceedings
under this chapter; and if, after the issuing of the order, the
defendant being a person, should die, or a corporation, and its
charter should expire by limitation, forfeiture, or otherwise,
the proceeding shall be carried on; but in all such cases, other
than where the defendant was a foreign corporation, his legal
representatives shall be made parties to the action.

SEC. 224. The defendant may, at any time before judgment, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff, move the court
for additional security on the part of the plaintiff; and if, on
such motion, the court is satisfied that the surety in the plaintiff’s undertaking has removed from this territory, or is not
sufficient for the amount thereof, it may vacate the order of
attachment and direct restitution of any property taken under
it, unless, in a reasonable time, to be fixed by the court, sufficient security is given by the plaintiff.

fraudulent intent; or, 3. Is about to remove his property, or a
material part thereof, with the intent, or to the effect, of

bring an action on a claim before it is due, and have an
attachment against the property of the debtor.

SEC. 228. The attachment authorized by the last section,
may be granted by the court in which ‘the action is brought,
or by a judge thereof, but before such action shall be brought,
or such attachment shall be granted, the plaintiff, his agent or

whether of law or of fact, in an action.’

SEC. 260. Issues of law must be tried by the court, unless referred as provided in section two hundred and seventyeight. Issues of fact, arising in actions for the recovery of

proceed in the following order, unless the court for special
reasons otherwise direct: 1. The plaintiff must briefly state
his claim, and he may briefly state the evidence by which he
expects to sustain it. 2. The defendant must then briefly
state his defence, and may briefly state the evidence be expects to offer in support of it. 3. The party who would be
defeated, if no evidence were given on either side, must first
procure his evidence; the adverse party will then produce his
evidence. 4. The parties will then be confined to rebutting
evidence, unless the court, for good reasons, in furtherance of
justice, permits them to offer evidence in their original case.
5. When the evidence is concluded, either party may request
instructions to the jury on points of law, and be heard upon
the same, which shall be given or refused by the court; which
instructions shall be reduced to writing, if either party require
it. 6. The parties may then submit or argue the case to the
jury. In the argument, the party required first to produce_
his evidence, shall have the opening and conclusion. If several defendants, having separate defences, appear by different
counsel, the court shall arrange their relative order. 7. The
court may again charge the jury after the argument is concluded.

SEC. 264. Whenever, in the opinion of the court, it is
proper for the jury to have a view of property which is the

' subject of litigation, or of the place in which any material

fact occurred, it may order them to be conducted in a body
under the charge of an oflicer to the place, which shall be
shown to them by some person appointed by the court for
that purpose. While the jury are thus absent, no person
other than the person so appointed, shall speak to them on
any subject connected with the trial. ’

SEC. 265. When the case is finally submitted to the jury,
they may decide in court or retire for deliberation. If they
retire, they must be kept together in some convenient place,
under the charge of an officer until they agree upon a verdict,
or are discharged by the court, subject to the discretion of the
court to permit them to separate temporarily at night, and at
their meals. The officer having them under his charge, shall
not suffer any communication to be made to them, or make
any himself, except to ask them if they have agreed upon
their verdict, unless by order of the court, and he shall not,
before_ their verdict is rendered, communicate to any person
the state of their deliberations, or the verdict agreed upon.

SEC. 266. If the jury are permitted to separate either
during the trial, or after the case is submitted to them,‘they
shall be admonished by the court that it is their duty not to

duty not to form or express any opinion thereon, until the
cause is finally submitted to them.

SEC. 267. After the jury have retired for deliberation, if
there be a disagreement between them as to any part of the
testimony, or if they desire to be informed as toany part of

point of law shall be given, and the court may give its recollection as to the testimony on the point in dispute, in the
_presence of, or after notice to the parties or their counsel.

SEC. 268. The jury may be discharged by the court on
account of the sickness of a juror, or other accident or calamity

be tried again immediately, or at a future time, as the court
may direct.

SEC. 270. When the jury have agreed upon their verdict,
they must be conducted into court, their names called by the
clerk, and the verdict rendered by the foreman. When the
verdict is announced, either party may require the jury to be
polled, which is done.by the clerk asking each juror if it is

his verdict. If any one answers in the negative, the jury must
again be sent out for further deliberation.

SEC. 271. The verdict shall be written, signed by the
foreman, and read by the clerk to the jury, and the inquiry
made whether it is their verdict. If any juror disagrees, the
jury must be sent out again; but if no disagreement be expressed, and neither party requires the jury to be polled, the
verdict is complete, and the jury discharged from the case.
If, however, the verdict be defective in form only, the same

may, with the assent of the jury before they aredischarged,

be corrected by the court.

SEC. 272. The verdict of a jury is either general or
special. A general verdict is that by which they pronounce
generally upon all or any of the issues, either in favor of the
plaintiff or defendant. A special verdict is that by ‘which
the jury hnds the facts only. It must present the facts as
established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove
them; and they must be so presented as that nothing remains
to the court, but to draw from them conclusions of law.

SEC. 273. In every action for the recovery of money
only, or specific real property, the jury, in their discretion,
may render a general or special verdict. In all other cases,
the court may direct the jury to find a special verdict in
writing, upon all or any of the issues; and in all cases may
instruct them if they render a general verdict, to find upon
particular questions of fact to be stated in writing, and may
direct a written finding thereon. The special verdict or
finding must be filed with the clerk and entered on the
journals. '

SEC. 274. When the special finding of facts is inconsistent with the general verdict, the former controls the latter, and
the court may give judgment accordingly. T

to appear at the trial by himself or attorney. 2. By written
consent in person, or by attorney, filed with the clerk. 3. By
oral consent in open court entered on the journal.
SEC. 277. Upon the trial of questions of fact by the
' court,°it shall not be necessary for the court to state its finding, except, generally, for the plaintiff or defendant, unless
"one of the_parties request it, with the view of excepting to
the decision of the court upon the questions of law involved
in the trial; in which case the court shall state in writing the
conclusions of fact found-, separately, from the conclusions of

law.

ARTICLE IV.—TRIAL BY Bmumzns.

SEC. 278. All or any of the issues in the action, whether
of fact or law, or both, may be referred, upon the written
consent of the parties, or upon their oral consent in court entered upon the journal.

SEC. 279. When the parties do not consent, the court
may, upon the application of either, or of its own motion,
direct a referee in either of the following cases: 1. Where
the trial of an issue of fact shall require the examination of
mutual accounts, or where the account is on one side only,
and it shall be made to appear to the court, that it is necessary that the party on the other side should be examined asia
witness to prove the account; in which cases the referees may
be directed to hear and report upon the whole issue, or upon
any specific question of fact involved therein; or, 2. Where
the taking of an account shall be necessary for the information of the court before judgment, in cases which may be
determined by the court, or for carrying a judgment into
effect; or, 3. Where a question of fact, other than upon the
pleadings, shall arise upon motion or otherwise, in any stage
of the action.

SEC. 280. The trial before referees is conducted in the
same manner as a trial by the court. They have the same
power to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses,
to administer all necessary oaths in the trial of the ease, and
to grant adjournments, as the court, upon such trial. They

must state the facts found and the conclusions of law separately, and their decision must be given, and may_be excepted
to and reviewed in like manner. The report of the referees
upon the whole issue stands as the decision of the court, and
judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if

SEC. 433. All lands, as well as goods and chattels of the
debtor, not exempt by law from levy, seizure, and sale under

.an1axecution, shall be bound from the time they shall be

seized in execution.

SEC. 434. If execution shall not be sued out within five
years from the date of any judgment, that now is or may
hereafter be rendered in any court of record in this territory;
or if five years shall have intervened between the date of the
last execution issued on such judgment and the time of
sueing out another writ of execution thereon, such judgment
shall become dormant, and shall cease to operate as a lien on
the estate of the judgment debtor.

SEC. 435. The writ of execution against the property of
the judgment debtor, issuing from any court of record in this
territory, shall command the officer, to whom it is directed,
that of the goods and chattels of the debtor, he cause to be
made the money specified in the writ; and for want of goods
and chattels, be cause the same to be made of the lands and
tenements of the debtor; and the exact amount of the debt,
damages, and costs, for which the judgment is entered, shall
be indorsed on the execution.

SEC. 436. When two or more writs of execution against
the same debtor shall be sued out during the term in which
judgment was rendered, or within ten days thereafter, and
when two or more writs of execution against the same debtor
shall be delivered to the oflicer on the same day, no preference
shall be given to either of such writs; but if a sufficient sum

of money be not made to satisfy all executions, the amount
made shall be distributed to the several creditors in proportion
to the amount of their respective demands. In all other
cases the writ of execution first delivered to the officer shall

be first satisfied. And it shall be the duty of the officer to
indorse on every Writ of execution the time when he received

the same. No judgment shall be a lien upon the lands, goods,
or chattels of a judgment debtor, until said lands, goods, or
chattels shall be levied upon or seized in execution.

SEC. 437. The officer to whom a writ of execution is
delivered, shall proceed immediately to levy the. same upon‘

the goods and chattels of the debtor; but if no goods and
chattels can be found, the officer shall indorse on the writ of
execution, “no goods,” and forthwith levy the writ of execution upon the lands and tenements of the debtor, which may
be liable to satisfy the judgment.

SEC. 438. If the officer, by virtue of any writ of execution, issued from any court of record in this territory, shall

levy the same on any goods and chattels claimed by any«

person other than the defendant, it shall be the duty of said
officer forthwith to give notice in writing. to some justice of
the peace in the county, in which shall be set forth the names
of the plaintiff‘ and defendant, together with the name of the
claimant; and at the same time he shall furnish the said
justice of the peace with a schedule 'of the property claimed.
And it shall be the duty of such justice of the peace, immediately upon the receipt of such notice and schedule, to make
an entry of the same upon his docket, and issue a writ of
summons, directed to the sheriff, or any constable of the
county, commanding him t.o summon five disinterested men,
having the qualifications of electors, who shall be named in
said summons, to appear before him, the said justice, at the
time and place therein mentioned, which time shall not be
more than three days after the date of said writ, to try and
determine the right of the claimant to the property in controversy. And it shall be the duty of the claimant to give two
days’ notice, in writing, to the plaintiff or other party for
whose benefit such execution was issued and levied as aforesaid, his agent or attorney, if within the county, of the time
and place of such trial ; and he shall, moreover, prove to the
satisfaction of said justice that such notice was given, or that

the same could not be given by reason of the absence of the

party, his agent or attorney.
SEC. 439. The jury summoned as aforesaid, shall be

i sworn to try and determine the right of the claimant to the

property in controversy, and a true verdict to give, according
to the evidence. If the jury shall find the right to said goods
and chattels, or any part thereof, to be in the claimant, they
shall also find the value thereof, and the justice shall render
judgment upon such finding of the jury, for the claimant, that
he recover’ his costs against the plaintiff in execution, or other
party to the same, for whose benefit the execution issued, and
also that he have restitution of said goods and chattels, or
any part thereof, according to the finding of the jury. But if
the right of the said goods and chattels, and every part
thereof, shall not be in the claimant according to the finding
of said jury, then the said justice shall render judgment on
such finding, in favor of the plaintiff in execution, or other
party for whose benefit the same was issued and levied,
against_said claimant for costs, and award execution thereon.

Such justice of the peace, in the taxation of costs accruing
by reason of such claim and trial, shall allow each juror summoned and sworn, the sum of fifty cents; and for the sheriff,

constable, or other officer, and witnesses, and for himself, he

shall tax such fees as are allowed by law, to each, respectively, for like services ‘rendered in other cases. Such judgment,for the claimant (unless an undertaking shall be executed, as provided in the next section), shall be a justification

of the officer in returning “no goods” to the writ of execution, by virtue of which the levy has been made, as to such

part of the goods and chattels as were found to belong to

such claimant.

SEC. 440. If the jury shall find the property or any part
thereof to be in the claimant, and the plaintiff in execution
shall, at any time within three days after such trial, tender to
the sheriff or other officer having such property in his custody
on execution, an undertaking _with good and suflicient sureties, payable to such claimant, in double the amount of the
value of such property as assessed by the jury, to the effect
that they will pay all damages sustained by reason of the
detention or sale of such property, then the sheriff or other
officer shall deliver said undertaking to claimant, and proceed

to sell such property, as if no such trial of the right of property had taken place, and shall not be liable to the claimant

therefor.
SEC. 441. In all cases where a sheriff, coroner, or other

-officer shall, by virtue of an execution, levy upon any goods

and chattels, which shall remain upon his hands unsold, for
want of bidders, for the want of time ‘to advertise and sell,
or any other reasonable cause, the officer may, for his own
security, take of the defendant an undertaking, with security
in such sum as he may deem suflicient, to the effect that the
said property shall be delivered to the officer holding an execution for the sale of the same, at the time and place appointed by said officer, either by notice given _in writing to
said defendant in execution, or by advertisement, published in
a newspaper printed in the county, naming therein the day
and place of sale. If the defendant shall fail to deliver the
goods and chattels at the time and place mentioned in the
notice to him given, or to pay to the officer holding the execution the full value of said goods and chattels, or the
amount of said debt and costs, the undertaking, given as
aforesaid, shall be considered as broken, and may be proceeded on as in other cases.

SEC. 442. The oflicer who levies upon goods and chattels, by virtue of an execution issued. by a court of record,
before he proceeds to sell the same, shall cause public notice
to be given of the time and place of sale, for at least ten
days before the day of sale. The notice shall be given by
advertisement, published in some newspaper printed in the
county, or, in case no newspaper be printed thereij by setting up advertise-merl'ts_ in five public places in the county;
two advertisements shall be put up in the precinct where the
sale is to be held. And where goods and chattels levied upon
cannot be sold for want of bidders, the officer making such
return shall annex to the execution a true and perfect inventory of such goods and chattels; and the plaintiff in such
execution may thereupon sue out another writ of execution
directing the sale of the property levied upon as aforesaid;
but such goods and chattels shall not be sold, unless the time
and place of sale be advertised, as hereinbefore provided.

SEC. 443. When any writ shall issue, directing the sale
of property previoiisly taken in execution, the officer issuing

said writ shall, at the request of the person entitled to the
benefit thereof, his agent or attorney, add thereto a command
to the officer to whom such writ shall be directed, that, if the
property remaining in his hands, not sold, shall, in his opinion,
be insufficient to satisfy.the judgment, he shall levy the same
upon the lands and tenements, goods and chattels, or either,
as the law shall permit, being the property of the judgment
debtor, sufiicient to satisfy the debt.

SEC. 444. If execution be levied on lands and tenements,
the officer levying such execution shall call an inquest of
three disinterested freeholders, who shall be resident within
the county where the lands taken in execution are situate,
and administer to them an oath, impartially to appraise the
property so levied upon, upon actual view; and such freeholders shall forthwith return to the said officer, under their
hands, an estimate of the real value, in money, of said

property.

SEC. 445. The officer receiving such return shall forthwith deposit a copy thereof with the clerk of the court from
which the writ issued, and immediately advertise and sell
such real estate, agreeably to the provisions of this title.

SEC. 446. If, upon such return, as aforesaid, it appear,
by the inquisition, that two thirds of the appraised value of
said lands and tenements so levied upon is sufficient to satisfy
the execution, with costs, the judgment on which such execution issued shall not operate as a lien, on the residue of the

thereof, be paid, then, on proof of such payment and tender

judgment or final order shall be, shall take a written undertaking, to be executed on the part of the plaintiff in error to
the adverse party, with one or more sufficient sureties, as follows: 1. When the judgment or final order sought to be
reversed, directs the payment of money, the written undertaking shall be in double the amount of the judgment or
order, to the effect that the plaintiff in error will pay the condemnation-money and costs, in case the judgment or final
order shall be affirmed in whole or in part. 2. When it

aforesaid, exclusive of the time of such disability.

SEC. 529. No proceeding to reverse, vacate, or modify
any judgment rendered, or final order made by a justice of .

by one or more sufficient sureties, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay all the costs which have accrued, or may accrue

court reversing the same'shall proceed to render such judgment as the court below should have rendered, or remand the
cause to the court below, for such judgment; and the court
reversing such judgment, or final order, shall not issue execution in causes that are removed before them on error, on
which they pronouhced judgment, as aforesaid, but shall send
a special mandate to the court below, as the. case may require,
to award execution thereupon; and such court, to which such
special mandate is sent, shall proceed in such cases in the

same manner as if such judgment or final order had been rendered therein. And, on motion and good cause shown, it
may suspend any execution made returnable before it, by
order of the supreme court, in the same manner as if such
execution had been issued from its own court, but such power
shall not extend further than to stay proceedings until the

matter can be further heard by the supreme court.

certiorari.

SEC. 536. If the judgment of a justice of the peace, taken
on error, as herein provided, to the district court be aflirmed,
it shall be the duty of such court to render judgment against
the plaintiff in error, for the costs of suit, and to award execution therefor; and the court shall thereupon order its clerk
to certify its decision in the premises, to the justice, that the
judgment affirmed may be enforced, as if such proceedings
in error had not been taken; or such court may award execution _to carry into effect the judgment of such justice, in the

same manner as if such judgment had been rendered in the
district court.

SEC. 537. When the proceedings of a justice of the
peace are taken, on error, to the district court, in manner

the defence to the action, if the party applying was defendant. On such petition a summons shall issue and be served
as in the commencement of an action: Provided, Such
summons shall not issue in any case in which there is, upon

waiver of error by the party or his attorney, unless the court
or a judge thereof shall indorse upon the petition permission
to issue such summons.

SEC. 540. The proceedings to correct mistakes or omissions of the clerk, or irregularity in obtaining a judgment or
order, shall be by motion, upon reasonable notice to the adverse party or his attorney in the action. The motion to

grounds to vacate or modify a judgment or order, before trying or deciding upon the validity of the defence or cause of
action.

petition, until it is adjudged that there is a valid defence to
the action in which the judgment is rendered; or if the plaintiff seeks its vacation, that there is a valid cause of action;
and where a judgment is modified, all liens and sureties
obtained under it, shall be preserved to the modified judgment.

SEC. 543. The party seeking to vacate or modify a judgment or order, may obtain an injunction suspending proceedings on the whole or part thereof, which injunction may be

that the party is entitled to have such judgment or order
vacated or modified.

SEC. 544. When the judgment was rendered before the
action stood for trial, the suspension may be granted as provided in the last section, although no valid defence to the _

action, in which security for costs has been given, as required
by this chapter, the court, on motion of the defendant, or any

inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel ‘the;
performance of an act, which the law specially enjoins as a
duty resulting from an oflice, trust, or station. But though it
may require an inferior tribunal to exercise its judgment, or
proceed to the discharge of any of its functions, it cannot
control judicial discretion.

SEC. 583. This writ may not be issued in any case,
where there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of the law. It may issue on the information of the
party beneficially interested.

SEC. 584. The writ is either alternative or peremptory.
The alternative writ must state concisely the facts showing
the obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and his
omission to perform it, and command him,‘ that immediately

he do the act required to be performed, or show cause before
the court whence the writ issued, at a specified time and
place, why he has not done so; and that he, then and there

commanded.. The peremptory writ. must be in a similar
form, except that the words requiring the defendant to show
cause why he has not done as commanded, must be omitted.

SEC. 585. When the right to require the performance of
the act is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse can
be given for not performing it, a peremptory mandamus may

civil action.

SEC. 589. If no answer be made, a peremptory mandamus
must be allowed against the defendant. If an answer be

.made containing new matter, the same shall not, in any

respect, conclude the -plaintiff, who may, on the trial or other
proceeding, avail himself of any valid objection to its suHiciency, or may countervail it by proof, either in direct denial
or by way of avoidance. _

SEC. 590. No other pleading or written allegation is
allowed, than the writ and answer. These are the pleadings

the further proceedings thereon had in the same manner as in
a civil action.

recover the damages which he shall have sustained, to be
ascertained by the court, or a jury, or by referees, in a civil

party, for the making of such return.

to any public officer, body, or board, commanding the performance of any public duty, specially enjoined by law, if it
appear to the court that such officer, or any member of such
body or board, has, without just excuse, refused or neglected
to perform the duty so enjoined, the _court may impose a
fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, upon every such officer or member of such body or board. Such fine, when collected, shall be paid into the treasury of the county, where
the duty ought to have been performed, for the use of common schools; and the payment thereof is a°bar to an action
for any penalty incurred by such officer or member of such

body or board, by reason of his refusal or neglect to perform
the duty so enjoined.
