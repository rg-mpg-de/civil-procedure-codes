PROCESS.
•
Section i. That whenever suit shall be brought against any person or

Passed at Dover, February 10, 1855.
CHAPTER 270. Vol. 11. Laws of Delaware.
AN ACT IN RELATION TO THE TRIAL OF ISSUE OF FACT IN THE SUPERIOR
COURT.
Section I. That in all Civil Causes where matters of fact are at issue, if
the parties agree, such matters of fact shall be tried by the Court, and judgment
rendered upon their decision thereon, as in cases tried by a Jury under
the present practice.
Section i. That from and after the passage of this act, it shall not be
lawful, at the suit of any non-resident, to arrest and hold to bail on mesne
process anv person who raav be a non-resident of this State at the time of
F . J. r , - , , .
lssuing such process against such person or persons, for any debt contracted
without the limits of this State. If any such non-resident shall be so arrest-
ed, he may apply by petition in writing to any Judge of this State, setting
forth his residence and the State in which said debt was contracted, and it
shall be the duty of said Judge, on the production of satisfactory proof that
the plaintiff was a non-resident at the time of issuing the process, and also
that the petitioner is a non-resident of this State, and that the debt on which
. , . \ , ...... ,. 1
said petitioner was arrested was not contracted in this State, to discharge
said petitioner from custody ; but this act shall not be construed as affecting
in any degree the law of attachment.
SEC 2. That "An act relating to arrests in civil cases in the State of
Delaware," passed at Dover, March 3d, 1853, be, and the same is hereby,
repealed, made null and void.
place and time of the return thereof, to answer as therein re
quired, the said bond shall be void.
Sec. 2. The sum in which bail is demanded shall be in
dorsed on the writ. The Superior Court, or any judge thereof,
may, on complaint, fix the amount of bail, or discharge the
defendant on common bail.
The plaintiff, or his agent, or attorney, if residing in the
county, shall have notice of the time and place of hearing
such complaint, and the plaintiff 's affidavit shall be received to
show cause of bail. When a defendant is discharged on com
mon bail, his appearance shall be entered on the return of the
process. When a bail bond is given, the defendant cannot
appear without giving special bail to the action, unless by or
der of court, or with the plaintiff's consent.
SEC. 3. The sheriff, or officer to whom a bail bond is given,
or his executors, or administrators, shall, upon request, assign
it to the plaintiff, or his executors, or administrators, by in
dorsement under seal, attested by one or more witnesses.
By special order of court the assignment may be to a per
son for whose use the action is brought, or his executors, or
administrators.
Sec. 4. A person arrested by virtue of any attachment
for contempt (except attachments for non-performance of de
crees, or the non-payment of money, or returnable forthwith,)

ing the attachment may fix the amount of bail.
If no sum be indorsed on the writ, the officer executing it
shall set down a reasonable sum.
Sec, 5. Action upon a bail bond must be brought in the
same court as the original action ; and when the bond is duly
assigned, the action shall be in the name of the assignee, or
his executors, or administrators. The court may grant to the
bail and to the parties respectively in the original action, such
relief, upon such terms, and in such manner as shall be just
and equitable.
Sec. 6. Proceedings against bail, on a bail bond taken on
an attachment issued out of the Court of Chancery, shall
be by petition to the said court, which shall decree thereon
according to equity.
Sec. 7. Insufficient bail shall be regarded as no bail. A
sheriff, or officer, taking insufficient bail, shall be deemed to
have voluntarily permitted the defendant to escape, and shall
be liable accordingly. One or more citizens of the county, of
ability to answer the sum in which bail is required, shall be
sufficient bail.
Sec. 8. Although bail be taken, the court shall, upon appli
cation, grant a rule upon the sheriff, or officer, to bring the
body of the defendant into court, in the same manner as if no
bail were taken ; but if the bail be sufficient, and the sheriff,
or officer, will assign the bail bond, no further proceeding
shall be had against him, if he cannot find the defendant so as
to comply with the rule.
Sec. 9. It shall be lawful for any defendant, committed to
prison by virtue of a capias ad respondendum, * * * m
to enter special bail to the action at any time before final
judgment is obtained against him.
[And also for any person who is now or may hereafter be
imprisoned, having been surrendered by his bail, to enter
special bail anew at any time before he shall be charged in
execution by a writ of capias ad satisfaciendum delivered to
the Sheriff."]
Sec. 10. In every action for a penalty imposed by law, s
special bail may be required in the amount of the penalty ™
sued for, upon affidavit that the offence has been committed, p
SEC. II. Special bail shall have the right to take and ren-
der his principal in his own discharge, and to commit him to b
jail, at any time before the end of the term to which the scire
facias, or other lawful process, is returnable ; and a copy of
the entry of special bail shall be his sufficient warrant. If the
first scire facias be returned " nihil," a second shall be issued
and returned before the liability of the bail is fixed.
Sec. 12. Bail may satisfy any judgment rendered against
his principal ; and the plaintiff, or party having the interest
therein, shall assign the same to the bail, or his executors, or j
administrators, at the risk of the assignee, whenever it is so
satisfied.
If several persons be bail, one or more, satisfying the judg-
ment, shall be entitled to the assignment.
Sec. 13. The assignee may proceed in the name of the
plaintiff, or his executors, or administrators, for his own use,
to execute the judgment against the principal, or his execu-
tors, or administrators, or to recover from other bail his pro
portionable share, or may make himself a party to the judg
ment by scire facias and proceed in his own name, as assignee.
Sec. 14. If any person be indebted to an inhabitant of this
State, and the day of payment is not arrived, the creditor, or
any one for him, on filing with the prothonotary an affidavit
that the defendant is indebted to him in a sum exceeding
fifty dollars, the time for payment of which is not yet come,
and that he, on good grounds, believes that said defendant is
about to leave the State, and to remove his effects, and has
refused to give better security for the debt, may issue a capias
against such debtor, and have him arrested ; and such debtor,
shall, on the return of the writ, be obliged to give better se
curity for the payment of such debt, if the court, on hearing,
shall see fit so to order, and he shall pay the costs.
If he fail to give such security, a domestic attachment may
be issued against him without the affidavit required by chap104.
But if the court shall consider that there was not suffi-
cient cause for the arrest, judgment shall be given that the
plaintiff pay to the defendant such costs and charges as the
court shall think fit to allow.

cause of action ; or upon affidavit made by the plaintiff, or
or some other credible person, and filed with the prothono-
tary, that the defendant is justly indebted to the plaintiff in a
sum exceeding fifty dollars, and has absconded from the place
of his usual abode\ or gone out of the State, with intent to de
fraud Jus creditors, or to elude process, as is believed.
Sec. 2. The writ of attachment shall be directed as other
writs are, and shall command the officer to attach the defend
ant by all his goods and chattels, rights and credits, lands and
tenements, in whose hands, or possession, soever, the same
may be found in his bailiwick, so that he be and appear at the
next Superior Court, to answer the plaintiff's demand ; and
that he summon the defendant's garnishees to appear at the
said court to declare what goods, chattels, rights, credits.

respectively.
SEC 3. If the defendant in the attachment, or any sufficient
r ... ... . . '
person for him, will, at any time betore judgment, appear and
put in special bail to the plaintiff's action, and to all other ac
tions brought against such defendant, to the value of the
property, rights, and credits attached, and the costs, then the
garnishees and all property attached, shall be discharged.
Sec. 4. The sheriff, or other officer, shall, under such writ,
attach all the defendant's property real and personal, and his «
rights and credits that can be found ; and shall take possession
of the said personal property, rights and credits, and have

therefor ; but if he cannot have actual possession thereof, he
shall notify the person in whose hands, or possession, they are
supposed to be, that he attaches the same at the plaintiff's
suit, for the use of all the defendant's creditors, and that he
doth summon him, as a garnishee, to appear and answer as

personal property, chattels and effects, so attached, shall be
delivered to the sheriff, unless the garnishee will give securi
ty for the same.

And if it be found that the garnishee had, at the time he
was notified of the attachment, or at any time after and before
his plea pleaded, any money, goods, chattels, or effects, of the
defendant in his hands, or possession, the jury shall render a
verdict for the plaintiff, or such other creditor, and assess

and transcribing pleadings, judgments, and other pro
ceedings in actions of law, and such regulations as to the pay
ment of costs, and otherwise for carrying into effect the said
alterations, as to them may seem expedient : provided, that

Said court with a view to the attainment, as far as practicable,
of the following improvements in practice :
First, simplifying and shortening the pleadings and other
proceedings ;

a more full and precise statement in the declaration, or by a
bill of particulars, and by a more definite statement of the
ground of defence ;

the court, upon hearing the exceptions, may correct any errors
in such report.
SEC. 6. If, upon the aforesaid proceeding, the assets be found
insufficient to pay all the debts and legacies of the testator,
execution shall be awarded only for such proportion of the as-^
sets as may be properly applicable to the plaintiff's legacy ;
but judgment for the whole legacy shall be entered and shall
stand as a security for the payment of the residue of the leg
acy, when sufficient assets for such payment shall come to the
hands of the executor, or administrator. A scire facias shall
lie for further execution, suggesting that other assets have
come to the hands of the executor, or administrator.
SEC. 7. The court shall exercise equitable powers in respect
to costs. In case of inexcusable neglect, or delay, on the part
of the executor, or administrator, to pay the legacy demanded,
or a proportional part thereof, the court may, in its discretion,

ered in an action brought for a legacy, without a reasonable
demand for the same first made upon the executor, or adminis
trator, who ought to pay the same.

could recover the premises in any form of action.
Sec. 2. If a tenant holding under a demise, be served with
a declaration in ejectment, his landlord, upon entering into
the common rule, shall be admitted defendant with the tenant
in such ejectment. If the tenant refuse to appear, and the land
lord apply to be admitted defendantjudgment shall be entered
against the casual ejector, with stay of execution subject to
the order of the court ; and the landlord on entering into the
common rule and admitting on record that he is, and, at the
time of commencing the action, was in the possession of the
premises mentioned in the declaration, or any described part
thereof for which he defends, shall be admitted defendant.
Sec. 3. If a tenant, being served with a declaration in eject
ment, neglect to give a notice thereof, without delay, to his
landlord, or his agent, he shall be liable, as is provided in sec
tion 72 of chapter 120.

premises, the term shall be extended for another year, for
which the tenant shall pay the rent, and all the stipulations
of the demise shall continue in force.
[Section four of this said chapter shall not be taken or held
to prescribe any time as to notice when the letting is for a lessf
time than a year ; but that when a letting is by the month, [a
month's] notice to quit shall be sufficient ; and when it is by the
week, a week's notice shall be sufficient.]
SEC 5. If the tenant, or any person coming into possession
by his permission, or by collusion with him, shall hold over
the demised premises after the end of the term, and after no-
tice as aforesaid given either by the tenant to the landlord, or
by the landlord to the tenant, or other person at the time in
possession of the demised premises ; the tenant, or per
son, so holding over, shall, either of them, at the landlord's,
election, be liable to pay double the rent that was payable
according to the demise, to be recovered by action, or levied
by distress, in the same manner as the single rent, if the de-
'
mise had continued, could have been ; and in every such case
the withholding of possession shall be deemed a forcible de
tainer and may be proceeded upon as such.

tenements, or hereditaments, by permission of a person, withq^
demise by deed or contract under seal for the rent, may

der seal, for a certain rent, shall not defeat such action, but
may be used to maintain the same,
Sec. 14. ' An action of assumpsit to recover satisfaction for
the use and occupation of lands, tenements, or hereditaments,
shall lie, where the person holding the same entered into pos-

Sec. 15. When any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, are
held by demise of a person having an estate therein deter-
11 1 ■ r • 1 • ,
minable on a life, or any contingency, and said estate shall determine

payable quarterly), the rent shall be apportioned according to
the time ; and the proportion thereof for the time the same
has been growing due, up to the determination of such estate,
shall bc paid to the lessor, or his executors, or administrators,
and may be recovered by action of debt, or on the case. If,
in case of the determination of such estate before the end of
the year, or quarter, the whole rent for the year, or quarter,
shall have been paid before such determination, a just propor
tion thereof, according to the time to run after such determin
ation to the end of the year, or quarter, shall be refunded.
This section shall extend as well to a rent in kind, as to a
rent of money.
Sec. 16. Grantees of reversions and remainders in any
lands, tenements, or hereditaments let to lease, and their

tels, before anything shall be applicable to such process.
Sec. 61. If the landlord before the seizure of the goods and
chattels of his tenant by virtue of such process as aforesaid,

notice in writing of the time and place thereof to the party at
whose suit the petitioner is imprisoned, or his attorney, or
agent, if there be such party, attorney, or agent, within the

nizance to the State in the penal sum of two hundred and fifty

his family ; such order with the petition shall be filed in the

liable touching any further imprisonment of the person upon
whose petition the said order was made.
The prothonotary shall forthwith certify the substance of c
such order, recognizance and entry to the sheriff, or jailer, of
the county ; and the petitioner shall thereupon be discharged D
from imprisonment at the suit of the party causing such en
try to be made.
Such entry shall in no manner impair the said recognizance,
nor have any other effect than to discharge the petitioner
from further imprisonment at the suit of the party causing it
to be made.
[But any person imprisoned as aforesaid may prefer a peti- A
tion to the superior court in term time, or to any judge thereof
in vacation, setting forth that he is willing and able to give
" " c
to the said creditor good and sufficient security for the pay- j
ment of the said debt or damages or costs as aforesaid, within
a reasonable time; and if, upon the hearing of the said petition,
and reasonable notice in writing of the time and place thereof
to the party at whose suit the petitioner is imprisoned, or his
attorney, or agent, if there be such party, attorney, or agent
within the county, it shall appear that the petitioner is able to
give such security, the said court, or judge thereof in vaca
tion, shall proceed to order security to be given and taken in0
such form, and for the payment of the said debt or damages
and costs, in such time and manner as to the said court or judge
shall seem meet and proper in the case, and on such security
*be given and approved by the said court or judge, an order
shall be made for the immediate discharge of the petitioner
from said imprisonment.]

ted.

SEC. 38. Any proceeding, or order, under this chapter, shall
not discharge any person imprisoned by the authority of the

that to which such proceedings, or order, relates ; but such
person, notwithstanding such proceeding, or order, shall be
detained for such other cause, according to the nature and ef
fect thereof.
Sec. 39. The foregoing provisions for the discharge of a
person imprisoned on civil process, upon failure of the party
at whose suit such person is imprisoned to indemnify the
county as aforesaid, shall not apply to the case of a prisoner
remanded by the court upon the trial of allegations of fraud,
or for refusing his consent to serve his creditor ; nor to the
case of a white citizen of this State imprisoned by virtue of a
capias ad satisfaciendum, or for the non-performance of a de
cree for the payment of money, upon an affidavit of fraud ;
nor to the case of any person whatsoever imprisoned by virtue
of civil process, whether original, or final, or whether issuing

shall, within five days after the imprisonment of such person,
file in the office of the prothonotary, or register in chancery,
issuing the process, an affidavit of fraud against the person so
imprisoned, in the same form as by law is required to be filed
before the issuing of a capias ad satisfaciendum against a
white citizen of this-State.
A person imprisoned as aforesaid, against whom such affida
vit of fraud shall be filed within five days after his imprison
ment, as above provided, shall have the same benefit of a
hearing of the specifications of fraud in such affidavit set forth
before a judge, and upon like proceedings, as in the case of an
affidavit of fraud filed before the issuing of a capias ad satis
faciendum.

ceeding relates.

herein limited therefor, the writ shall fail of a sufficient ser
vice or return by any unavoidable accident, or by any default,
or neglect, of the officer to whom it is committed ; or if the

feated, by the death of any party thereto, or for any matter of
