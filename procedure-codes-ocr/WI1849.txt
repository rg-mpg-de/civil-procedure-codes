mortgage, the court shall not only have power to decree and com- 
pel the - delivery of the possession of the mortgaged premises to
the purchaser thereof, but on the coming in of the report of sale,

by the mortgagor of any balance of the mortgage debt that may
remain unsatisfied after a sale of the premises, in the cases in
which such balance is recoverable at law; and for that purpose,
may issue the necessary executions as in other cases against other
property of the mortgagor. 
SEC. 78. After such bill shall be filed, while the same is pend-
ing, and after a decree rendered thereon, no proceedings whatever 
shall be had at law for the recovery of the debt secured by the
mortgage, or any part thereof, unless authorized by the court of 
chancery. 
SEC. 79. If the mortgage debt be secured by the obligation or other
evidence of debt hereafter, executed, of any other person besides
the mortgagor, the complainant may make such person a party to
the bill, and the court may decree payment of the balance of such
debt remaining unsatisfied, after a sale of the mortgaged premises,
as well against such other person as the mortgagor, and may en-
force such decree as in other cases. 
SEC. 80. Upon filing a bill for the foreclosure or satisfaction of
a mortgage, the complainant shall state therein, whether any pro-!:~~'° 
ceedings have been had at law, for the recovery of the debt se-
cured thereby, or any part thereof; and whether such debt or any 
part thereof, has been collected. 
SEC. 81. If it appear that any judgment has been obtained in a
suit at law, for the moneys demanded by such bill or any part 
thereof, no proceedings shall be had in such case, unless to an ex-
eeution against the property of the defendant, in such judgment,
the sheriff' shall have returned that the said execution is unsatisfied
in whole or in part, and that the defendant has no property where-
of to satisfy such execution, except the mortgaged premises. 
SEC. 82. All sales of mortgaged premises under the decree of
the court, shall be made by the sheriff, in the county where t)ie. 
premises, or some part of, them, are situated, unless otherwi~ di-

SEC. 83. Deeds shall thereupon be executed by such sheriff,
which shall vest in the purchaser the same estate, and no other or 
greater than would have vested in the mortgagee, if the equity of 
redemption had been foreclosed ; and such deeds shall be as valid 
as if the same were executed by the mortgagor and iµortgageei
and shall be an entire bar against each of them, and against all
parties to the suit in which the decree for such sale was made, 
and against their heirs respectively, and all claiming under such
heirs. 
SEc. 84. The proceeds of every sale made under the decree of
a court of chancery, shall be applied to the discharge of the debt 
adjudged by such court to be due, and. of the costs awarded; and:

use of the defendant, or of the person who may be entitled thereto,

court, for the term of three months without being applied for, the

at 9:ny time before the decree of sale, the principal and inter~.
due, with costs. 
SEC. 87. If after a decree for sale entered against a def endani
in such case, he shall bring into court the principal and interest· 
due, with the costs, the proceedings in the suit shall be stayed;
but the. court shall enter a decree of foreclosure and sale, to be
enforced by a further order of the court, upon a subsequent default
in the payment of any portion or installment of the principal, or of 
any interest thereafter to grow due. 
SEC. 88. If the defendant shall not bring into court the amount 
due, with costs, or if for any other cause, a decree shall pass for tbe
complainant, the court shall direct a reference to a proper officer, 
to ascertain and report the situation of the mortgaged premises;
and if it shall appear that the same can be sold in parcels, without
injury to the interests of the parties, the decree shall direct so 
much of the said premises to be sold, as will be sufficient to pay. 
the amount then due on such mortgage, with costs ; and such de­
cree shall remain as security for any subsequent default 
SEC. 89. If in the case mentioned in the preceding section, there 
shall be any default subsequent to such decree, in the payment of 
any portion or instalment of the principal or of any interest due .
upon such mortgage, the court may, upon the petition of the com­
plainant, by a further order founded upon such first decree, direct
a sale of so much of the mortgaged premises to be made under the 
said decree, as will be sufficient to satisfy the amount so due, with
the costs of such petition and the subsequent proceedings thereon;
and the same proceedings shall be had, as often as a default shall 
happen. ·
SEC. 90. If in any of the foregoing cases, it shall appear to the 
court, that the mortgaged premises are so situated, that the sale of
the whole will be most beneficial to the parties, the decree shall, 
in the first instance, be entered for the sale of the whole accord­
ingly. 
SEC. 91. In such case, the proceeds of such sale shall be ap,Pli- 
ed as well to the interest, portion or installment of the principal
due, as towards the whole or residue of the sum secured by such
mortgage, and not due and payable at the time of such sale; and 
if such residue do not bear interest, then the court may direct the
same to be paid, with a deduction of the rate of legal interest, for 
the time during which such residue shall not be due and payable ;
or may direct the balance of the proceeds.of such sale, after pay-
ing the sum due, with costs, to be put out at interest for the bene-
fit of the complainant, to be paid to him as the installments or por-
tions of the principal or the interest may become due, and the sur- 
plus for the benefit of the defendant, his representatives or as- 
signs, to be paid to them on the order of the court.

out of the state until he shall give security.
SEC. 93. No writ of ne exeat shall be granted but upon hill or 
petition filed, and affidavit of the complainant or some indifferent
witness, of the truth thereof ; and the court or judge granting such 
writ shall direct to be endorsed thereon the penalty of the bond
and security to be given by the defendant. 
SEC. 94. If the defendant shall, hr. answer or otherwise, satisfy
the court or judge granting such writ of ne exeat, that there is
no reason for his restraint, or shall give security for the perform-
ance of whatever decree m~y be made in the premises, the writ may

cutioa to the sheriff or other proper officer, to collect the amount
due on such judgment or decree, upon application to the proper
court, accompanied by an affidavit of the party, his agent or attor-
ney, setting forth the amount due on such judgment or decree, and 
 tllat the same is unsatisfied ; and the said court, upon being satisfied 
&t there is any sum due thereon, shall direct the clerk to issue
execution therefor: Provided, it shall appear to said court that a
written notice of such application has been served upon the oppo­ 
site party, his agent or attorney, at least twenty days before the 
term of the court at which such application shall be made, or that
a copy of such notice has been posted up in some conspicuous
place in the office of the clerk of the circuit court, when such op­
posite party shall not reside in the county where such judgment

arrested, and shall have been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part. 
SEc. 31. But if the defendant be imprisoned on execution in

upon such property. 
SEC. 38. In actions against two or more persons jointly indebted
upon any joint obligation, contract or liability if the process issu­
ed against all the defendants shall have been duly served upon 
either of them, the defendant so served shall answer to the plain-
tiff; and in such case, the judgment, if rendered in :favor of the 
t:>-- 
plaintiff, shall be against all the defendants, in the same manner as
if all had been served with process. 
SEC. 39. Such judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the lia-
bility of the defendant who was personally served with process in
the suit, or who appeared therein, but against every other defen-
dant, it shall be evidence only of the extent of the plaintiff's de-
mand, after the liability of such defendant shall have been estab-
lished by other evidence. 
SEC. 40. Execution · upon every such judgment as in the last
section mentioned, shall be issued in form against all the def en- 
dants, but the attorney issuing the same shall indorse thereon the

cess by which the action was commenced, and shall direct such
execution to be served as provided in the next section.

m term by an order to be entered in the minutes, or by any judge
thereof in vacation, by an order to be endorsed on such execu- 
tion.

tives or assigns, the sum which may have been paid by him to ac­
quire such title, together with interest thereon, at the rate of ten

reimbursement :

tor acquired the title of the original purchaser, be prior to the judg­

shall also pay to such first creditor the amount due on his judgment
or decree: 
3. But if such judgment or decree of the first creditor.at the time
of his acquiring the title of the original purchaser, shall have ceas­
ed to be a lien as against such second creditor, it shall not be neces­ 
sary to pay the amount thereof. 
SEC. 95. In the same manner, any third or other creditor, who
might according to the foregoing provisions acquire the title of the 
original purchaser, may become a purchaser thereof from the se­
cond, third or any other creditor who may have become such pur·

fore provided,

two years from the time of such sale, according to the foregoing 
provisions, then the officer making such sale, shall complete the
same by executing a conveyance of the premises so remaining un-
redeemed, either to the original purchaser or to the creditor who 
may have acquired the title of such ori~nal purchaser, or to the
creditor who may have purchased such title from any other credi- 
tor, as the case may be, which conveyance shall be valid and
effectual to convey all the right, title and interest which was sold
by such officer. 
SEC. 102. In case the person, who by the provisions of the pre-
ceding sections, would be entitled to a conveyance of any real

real estate, <lie or be removed before executing any conveya11ce in 
pursuance of such sale, such conveyance shall be executed by his 
under sheriff, in the same manner, and with the like effect, as if 
done by the sheriff.

which the execution issued, may, on the application of the plain­
tiff, appoint some suitable person to proceed on such execution and 
complete the same, instead of such under sheriff; and on the ap­ 
plication of any person entitled to a conveyance, the court may 
appoint a proper person to execute the same. The person soap­
pointed shall give such security as the court may require, and 
shall have the same power in relation to the object of his appoint­
ment, as the sheriff so dying or removed.

sum paid on such sale, with interest ; and such judgment shall be
deemed valid and effectual for that purpose, against the defen­ 
dant therein, his personal representatives, heirs and devisees ; but

mortgages, judgment or otherwise, whose title or whose incum­ 
brance shall have accrued before the levy of such further execu­
tion.

bution, the person a~grieved shall be entitled to use the original

ment ; and for that purpose, such judgment shall remain a lien
and charge upon such lands and tenements for the term of ten
years from the docketing thereof to the extent of the sum whic.h
ought to be so contributed, notwithstanding such sum, or any part
thereof, may have been paid by the party seeking such contribu-
tion.

upon any lands, nor shall they be subject to an execution as herein

amount received by each of them. 
SEC. 26 In such action the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover
the value of all the assets received by all the defendants in the 
suit, if necessary to satisfy his demand; and the amount of the re­ 
covery shall be apportioned among the defendants, in proportion to
the value of the assets received by each; and no allowance or de­
duction shall be made from such amount on account of there being
other relatives to whom assets have also been delivered. 
SEC. 27. Any of the next of kin, against whom a recovery
shall be had pursuant to the preceding sections, may maintain 
an action against the other relatives of the testator to whom any 
such assets may have been raid,jointly, or against any of them sep­ 
rately, for a just and equa contribution ; and shall be entitled :o
recover of each defendant, such an amount as shall be in the same
proportion to the whole sum collected of the plaintiff, as the
value of the assets delivered to such defendant bore to the value
of all the assets delivered to all the relatives of the deceased. 
SEc. 28. Actions by creditors of any deceased person to re­
cover the value of any assets that may have been paid by any ex­

tee. 
SEC. 31. If any action be brought against several relatives
jointly, or against several legatees Jointly for assets delivered to 
them, if a recovery be had against them, the costs of such action

the amount of the debt or damages recovered against each of
them. 
SEC. 32. In every such action, the judgment shall express the
amount recovered against each defendant, for debt or damages, 
and costs ; and the execution thereon shall correspond to such
judgment.

or by sreciality, to the extent of the estate, interest and right, in
the rea estate which shall have descended to them from, or been 
devised to them by, such person.
SEC. 35. But such heirs shall not be liable for any such debt, unless 
it shall appear that the personal assets of the deceased were not
sufficient to pay and discharge the same; or that after due pro­
ceedings before the proper probate court, and at law, the creditor
has been unable to co1lect such debt, or some part thereof, from the
personal representatives of the deceased, or from his next of kin 
or legatees. _
SEC. 36. In case the personal assets were sufficient to pay a part 
of such debt, or in case a part thereof shall have been collected,
as in the last section, mentioned, the heirs of such deceased person
shall be liable for the residue unpaid or unsettled. 
SEC. 37. But the two last sections shall not affect or impair the
liability of heirs for any debt of their ancestor, where such debt
was by his will expressly charged exclusively upon the real estate

resorting to the personal estate-

atee, heir or devisee, to any debt over other debts of the same
class, except those specified in the second class of the last section ;
nor shal1 a debt, due and payable, be entitled to a preference over
debts not due ; nor shall the commencement of a suit against any
next of kin, legatee, heir or devisee, for the recovery of any debt,
entitle such debt to any preference over others of the same class. 
SEc. 41. The next of kin, }elm.tees, heirs and devisees may show 
ha i:,- 
t there are debts of a prior class unsatisfied, or that there are
unpaid debts of the same class with that on which the suit is 
brought, and if it appear that the value of the personal property
delivered to them, or of the real estate, descended or devised to
them, does not exceed the debts of a prior class, judgment shall
be rendered in their favor. 
SEC. 42 If the personal property delivered to such next of kin, 
l , 
or egatee, or if the real estate descended or devised to such heirs
and devisees exceed the amount of debts which are entitled to a 
preference over the debt for which the suit is brought, judgment 
shall be rendered against them only for such a sum as shall be a 
just proportion to the other debts of the same class with that on
which the suit is brought. 
SEC. 43. If any debt of a prior class to that on which the suit
is brought, or of the same c Jass, shall have been paid by any next 
o( kin, legatees, heirs or devisees, they may give evidence of such
payment; and the amount of debts so paid shall be estimated in
ascertaining the amount to be recovered, in the same manner as if 
such debts were outstanding and unpaid, as prescribed in the two
last sections. 
SEC. 44. The heirs of any person who may be liable to any ere-
di tor of such person in consequence of lands having descended to 
them, shall be prosecuted jointly in a court of equity, but shall not

) I 
sha the remedy of the plaintiffs be suspended by reason of the
infancy of any such heir or devisee; but guardians to defend their
rights in such suits, shall be appointed, as in other cases. 
SEC. 46. In any bill filed against heirs to charge them on ac- 
count of any lands and tenements, or hereditaments, descended to
them, the complainant shall specify with convenient certainty the 
real estate so descended. 
SEc. 4 7. In such suit anl heir may show that at the time of the 
h f h d hi b I th b h d

!hereof, either by reference to a proper officer, or by awarding an
issue for that purpose. 
SEc. £19. If it appear that the lands, tenements or hereditaments
so descended, were not aliened by such heir, at the time of the 
commencement of the suit; or if the heir confess the action, and
show what lands, tenements or hereditaments have descended to
him, the court shall decree that the debt of the plaintiff, or the 
proportion thereof which he is entitled to recover, shall be levied
of such real estate so descended, and not otherwise. 
SEC. 50. Every final decree rendered in such suit shall have 
1
. h l d l d . .J 
preference as a- ien on t e rea estate escenr e , to any JUugment

commencement thereof, any such heir has aliened the lands, tene- 
ments or hereditaments descended to him, or any part thereof, he
shall be personally liable for the value of the estate so aliened, and 
judgment shall be rendered therefor, and execution awarded, as
m suits for his own debts. 
SEC. 52. In such cases, the preference herein before declared,
in respect to demands against the ancestor of such heir, shall ap- 
p1y, and such heir may show the same matters herein before al-
lowed, and the same proceedings and judgment shall be had 
thereon. 
SEc. 53. But no lands, tenements or hereditaments, aliened in

against such heir. 
SEC. 54. In suits brought against several heirs jointly, or seve-
ral devisees jointly, the amount which the plaintiff shall be entitled 
to recover shall be apportioned among all the heirs of the ances-
tor, or among all the devisees of the testator, in proportion to the 
n.lue of the real estate descended to such heirs, or devised to such
devisees respectively, as the case may be, and such proportion only
shall be recovered of each heir, or of each legatee. 
SEC. 55. The costs of such suit shall be apportioned among
the several defendants, in proportion to the debt or damages 
recovered against each of them; the decree shall express the
amount recovered against each defendant for debt, or damages
and costs; and the execution issued thereon shall conform to such
decree. 
SEC. 56. When a decree shall be rendered against any heirs or
devisees who are infants, no execution issued thereon shall be exe-
cuted against them, until the expiration of one year after the ren-
dition of such decree; but such execution may be executed against
any defendants in the same suit, who are of full age. 
SEC. 57. The solicitor issuing an execution in every such case,
shall .indorse thereon the names of the defendants, who are infants, 
and shall direct the sheriff not to execute the same against such
infants, until the time specified in the last section. 
SEC. 58. Devisees made liable by the foregoing provisions to the
creditors of their testator, shall not be so liable, unless it shall ap- 
pear that his personal assets and the real estate of the testator,
descended to his heirs, were insufficient to discharge such debt; or
unless it shall appear that after due proceedings before the proper
probate judge and at law, the creditor has been unable to recover
such debt, or some part thereof, from the personal representatives
of the testator, or from his next of kin or legatees, or from his
heirs. 
Ssc, 69. In either of the cases specified in the last section, the
amount of the deficiency of the personal assets, and of the real 
estate descended, to satisfy the debt of the plaintiff, and the amount
which such plaintiff may have failed to recover from the personal
representatives of the testator, his next of kin, legatees and heirs, 
may be recovered of the devisees of such testator, to the extent of
the real estate devised to them respectively. 
SEC. 60. But the two last sections shall not impair or affect the
liability of devisees for any debt of their testator, where such debt 
was by his will expressly charged exclusively upon the real estate
devised, or made payable exclusively by such devisee by the terms
of the will, or made payable out of the estate devised, before re­ 
soring to the personal estate, or to any other real estate descended
or devised. 
SEc. 61. It shall be incumbent on the creditor seeking to charge
any devisees, to show on the trial the facts and circumstances 
herein required to render them liable.
SEC. 62. The provisions herein contained with regard to heirs, 
and to proceedings by and against them, shall be .applicable to
suits and proceedings against devisees, who shall in like manner be 
sued jointly.
SEC. 63. Devisees shall be liable, in the same manner and to 
the same extent, as heirs, notwithstanding they may have aliened
the real estate devised before suit brought against them; but no 
real estate aliened in good faith by any devisee before the com­ 
mencement of a suit against him, shall be li ible to execution upon
or in any manner affected by a decree against such devisee. 
Of lnjan,ts born after making of Will, tc. 
SEC. 64. In cases where, by the provisions of any statute, a
child, born after the making of a will, shall be entitled to succeed
to a portion of the tes~ator's real and _personal estate, ~uc~ c~ld 
shall have the same rights and remedies to compel a distribution
of the personal estate and partition of the real estate, as are provided 
by law for the next of kin and for heirs, and shall in all respects
be liable in the same manner and to the same extent to the credi­
tors of his ancestor, in respect to the personal property delivered
to him and the real estate descended to him, as are herein prescribed
in relation to next of kin and heirs. 
SEc. 65. Such child shall be authorized to recover of the le-
gatees who may have received any property or effects of the testa­ 
tor, the portion of such property or effects to which he may be
entitled, by an action of replevin, or of trover or assumpsit, as the
case may require : and shall also be entitled to recover of the de­
visees of any real estate, under the will of the testator, such por­
tion of such real estate as shall belong to him. 
SEC. 66. In cases where a distribution of such personal estate
shall not have been made by the judge of probate to any such
child born after the making of a will, the court shall have power
to compel the same ; and the said court shall have power also to
compel just and equal contribution by the legatees under such will, 
to make up the portion of personal property :to which such child
shall be entitled. 
SEC. 67. The court shall also have power to compel partition
between the devisees of any real estate, and such child 80 entitled
to a portion of such real estate, so as to enforce a just and pro- 
. portionate contribution by each devisee,
SEC. 68. The foregoing provisions relative to a child born after 
the making of a will, shall apply equally in all respects to every
person who being a witness to a will, shall be entitled by the pro- 
visions of any statute to recover any portion of the personal or real
estate of the testator from the legatees and devisees named in such
will.

TITLE XXIV. 
CHAPTER 106. 
OF THE ACTION OF EJECTMENT. 
Sze. 7. It shall be sufficient for the plaintiff to aver, in his de-
claration, that on some day therein to be specified, and which shall
be after Lis title accrued, he was possessed of the premises in ques-
tion, describing them as hereinafter provided; and being so pos-
sessed thereof, that the defendant afterwards, on some day to be
stated, entered into such premises, and that he unlawfully with-
holds from the plaintiff the possession thereof, to his damage, any
nominal sum the plaintiff' shall think proper to state. 
SEc. 8. In such declaration the premises claimed shall be de·
scribed with convenient certainty, designating the number of the 
lot or township, if any, in which they snail be situated ; if none,
stating the names of the last occupants of lands adjoining the same,
if any; and if none, describing such premises by metes and bounds,
or in some other way, so that from such description possession of
the premises claimed ma1, be delivered. 
SEC. 9. If such plaintiff claims any undivided share or interest
in any premises, he shall state the same particularly in such decla- 
ration.
SEC. 10. If the action be brought for the recovery of dower, 
the declaration shall state that the plaintiff was possessed of the
one undivided third part of the premises, as her reasonable dower 
as a widow of her husband, naming him. In every other case the
plaintiff shall state whether he claims in fee, or whether he claims
for his own life or the life of another, or for a term of years, spe-
cifying such lives, or the duration of such term. 
SEC. 11. In any case other than where the action shall be
brought for the recovery of dower, the declaration may contain 
several counts, and several parties may be named as plaintiffs,
jointly, in one count, and separately in others. 
SEC 12. To such declaration there shall be subjoined a notice,
in writing, b1, the plaintiff or his attorney, addressed to the defend- 
ant, and notifying him,
1. That the said declaration will be filed, on some day in the 
then next term of the court in which the action is brought, speci­
fying such day; or if the same be served during the term of any
court, that it will be filed on such clay in such term, specifying the 
same: 
2. That upon filing the same a rule will be entered requiring 
such defendant to appear and plead to such declaration, within
twenty days after the entry of such rule: and, 
3. That if he neglect so to appear and plead, a judgment, by
default, will be entered against him, and the plaintiff" will recover
possession of such premises. 
SEc. 13. If the premises are actually occupied, the declaration 
shall be served by delivering a copy thereof, with the notice above
prescribed, to the defendant named therein who shall be in the oc-
cupation thereof, personally, or by leaving the same with some
person of proper age at the dwelling house of such defendant, if 
he be absent.
SEC. 14. If the premises claimed are not actually occupied, the 
declaration and notice shall be served on the defendant named
therein, personally, or if he cannot be found, by leaving the same 
with some person of proper age at the residence of such defend­
ant. 
SEC. 15. But where the declaration shall have been served in
any other manner than upon the defendant, personally, no rule to 
plead shall be entered, without the special order of the court.
SEC. 16. Instead of the rule to appear and enter into the con- 
sent rule, the plaintiff, on the day specified for that purpose in the
notice aforesaid, or on some other day thereafter, upon filing the
declaration with an affidavit of the due service of a copy thereof, 
and of the notice herein before required, shall be entitled to enter
a rule, requiring the def endaut to appear and plead within twenty 
days after the entering of such rule, and in case the defendant shall
neglect so to appear and plead within such time, his default shall 
be entered.
SEC. 17. No action in ejectment shall be commenced by an at­ 
torney, unless he has written authority from each one of the plain­
tiff"s, for eommencing the same; any written request of such plain­
tiff, or his agent, to commence such action, or any written recogni·
tion of the authority to commence the same, duly proved by the
affidavit of such attorney, or other competent witness, shall be suf. 
ficient presumptive evidence of such authority; such affidavit shall
be served on the defendant at the time of the service of the deela-
ration. 
SEC. 18. The defendant may demur to the declaration as in
personal actions, or he shall plead the general issue only, which 
shall be that the defendant is not ~ilty of unlawfully withholding
the premises claimed by the plaintiff, as alleged in the declaration,
and the filing and service of such plea or demurrer shall be
deemed an appearance in the cause. And upon such plea, the de­
fendant may give the same matter in evidence, and the same pro-
ceedings sba.11 be had as formerly, upon the plea of not guilty ia
the action of ejectment, except as herein otherwise provided. 
SEC. 19. Upon such plea, the defendant may give in evidence
any matter which, if pleaded in the former writ of right, or action
of dower, would bar the action of the plaintift 
SEC. 20. The consent rule is hereby abolished.
SEc. 21. It shall not be necessary for the plaintiff to prove an 
actual entry under title, nor the actual receipt of any profits of the
premises demanded; but it shall be sufficient for him to show a
right to the possession of such premises, at the time of the com­ 
mencement of the suit as heir, devisee, purchaser or otherwise.
SEC. 22. It shall not be necessary, on the trial, for the defend· 
ant to confess, nor for the plaintiff to prove lease, entry and ouster, 
or either of them, except as provided in the next section; but this
section shall not be construed to impair, nor in any way to affect 
any of the rules of evidence now in force in regard to the mainte­
nance and defence of the action. 
SEC. 23. If the action be brought by one or more tenants in co~­
mon, or joint tenants against their co-tenants, the plaintiff, in addi­ 
tion to all other evidence which he may be bound to give, shall be
required to prove, on the trial of the cause, that the defendant ac· 
tually ousted such t>laintifl', or did some other act amounting to a
total denial of his nght, as such co-tentant. 
SEC. 24. If the action be brought against several defendants,
and a joint possessio~ of all be proved, the plaintiff shall be enti- 
tled to a verdict against all, whether they shall have pleaded sepa ..
rately or jointly. 
SEc. 25. When the action is against several defendants, if it
h 
· 1 h f th di · l ·
appear on t e tna t at any o em occupy istinct parce s in 
severalty or jointly, and that other defendants possess other parcels 
in severalty or jointly, the plaintiff shall elect, at the trial, against 
which he will proceed, which election shaH be made before the
testimony in the cause shall be deemed closed, and a verdict shall
thereupon be rendered for the defendants not so proceeded against. 
SEC. 26. In the following cases, the verdict shall be rendered as
follows : 
1. If it be shown on the trial, that all the plaintiffs have a right
to recover the possession of the premises, the verdict in that respect 
shall be for the plaintiffs generalJy :
.2. If it appear that one or more· of the plaintiffs have a right to 
the possession of the yremises, and that one or more have not such
right, the verdict shal specify for which plaintiff the jury find, and
as to which plaintiff they find for the defendant : 
3. If the verdict be for any plaintiff, and there be several de­
fendants, the verdict shall be rendered against such of them as
were in possession of the premises, or as claimed title thereto at
the commencement of the action : 
4. If the verdict be for all the premises claimed, as specified in
the declaration, it shall in that respect be for such premises gene­ 
rally: 
5. If the verdict be for a part of the premises described in such
declaration, the verdict shall particularly specify such part as the
same shall have been proved, with the same certainty herein be­
fore required in the declaration, in the description of the premises
claimed: 
6. If the verdict be for an undivided share or interest in the
premises claimed, it shall specify such share or interest, and if for
an undivided share in part of the premises claimed, it shall specify
such share, and shall describe such part of the premises as herein
before required : 
7. The verdict shall also specify the estate which shall have
been established on the trial by the plaintiff, in whose favor it shall 
be rendered, whether such estate be in fee for his own life, or for
the life of another, stating such lives, or whether it be a term for 
years, and specifying the duration of such term.
Sxc. 27. If the right or title of a plaintiff in ejectment expire 
a.lteT the commencement of the suit, but before trial, the verdict 
sha11 be returned according to the fact, and judgment shall be
entered that he recover his damages by reason of the withholding 
of' the premises by the defendant to be assessed, and that as to
the premises claimed, the defendant go thereof without day. 
Sl!:C. 28. The action of ejectment shall not be abated by the
death of any plaintiff, or of one of several defendants, after issue 
and before verdict or judgment, but the same proceedings may be 
bad as in other actions, to substitute the names of those who may 
succeed to the title of the plaintiff' so dying, in which case the 
issue shall be tried as between the original parties, a~d in case of
the death of a defendant, the cause shall proceed agamst the other
defendants. , 
SEc. 29. In cases where no other provision is made, the judg­
ment in the action, if the plaintiff prevail, shall be that the plain­ 
tiff recover the possession of the premises, according to the verdict
of the jury, if there was such verdict, or if the judgment be by
default, according to the description thereof in the declaration,
with costs to be taxed. 
SEc. 30. The plaintiff recovering judgment, shall be entitled to
a writ of possession, which shall be substantially in the following
form: 
"The State of Wisconsin, to the sheriff, &c. 
"Whereas, A. B. bas lately, in the circuit court held in and for
the county of , by the judgment of the said court, re­ 
covered against C. D. one messuage, &c. ( describing the premises
recovered, with the like certainty as above provided,) which said
premises have been and are still unjustly withheld from the said 
A. B. by the said C. D., whereof he is convicted as appears to us
of record; and for as much as it is adjudged in the said court that
the said A. B. have execution upon his said judgment a~ the
said C. D,, according to the force, form and effect of his said re­
covery ; therefore we command you, that without delay you de­
liver to the said A. B. possession of the said premises so recovered,
with the appurtenances, and that you certify to &c., at &c.,on&c.,
in what manner you shall have executed this writ. (If there be 
costs to be collected, the proper clause mar. be here inserted, or a
separate execution may be issued therefor. Witness, &c." 
81:e. 31. Upon a judgment against a p aintiff, or one or more
plaintiff's, in cases where they shall be liable for costs, execution
for the collection of the same shall be issued, as upon judgments
in personal actions, and the proceeding by attachment for the col­ 
lection of such costs is hereby abolished.
SF.C. 32. Every judgment in the action of ejectment, rendered 
upon verdict, shall be conclusive as to the title established in sudl
action, upon the party against whom the same is rendered and 
against all persons claiming from, through or under such party, by
title accruing after the commencement of such action, subject to the
exceptions hereinafter contained. 
SEC. 33. The court in which such judgment shall be rendered,
at any time within one year thereafter, upon the application of the 
party against whom the same was rendered, his heirs or assigns,
and upon payment of all costs and damages recovered thereby 
shall vacate such judgment, and grant a new trial in such cause.
But no more than one new trial shall be granted under this sec· 
tion.
SEC. 34. Every judgment in ejectment rendered by default, 
shall, from and after two years from the time of docketing the
same, be conclusive upon the defendant, and upon all persons
claiming from or through him by title accruing after the commence­ 
ment of the action. But withm two years after the docketing of 
such judgment, on the application of the defendant, his heirs or 
assigns, and upon payment of all costs and damages recovered 
1 
thereby, the court shall vacate such judgment, and grant a new
trial. 
SEC. 35. But if the defendant in such action at the time of the
docketing Of the judgment by default, be either> 
I. Within the age of twenty-one years: or,
2. Insane : or, 
3. Imprisoned on any criminal charge, or in execution upon
some conviction of a criminal offence for any term less than for 
life: or,
4. A married woman:
The time during which such disability shall continue shall not be 
deemed any portion of the said two years ; but any such person
may bring an action for the recovery of such premises after that
time, and within two years after such disability shall be removed,
but not after that period. 
SEC. 36. If the person entitled to commence such action shall
die during the continuance of any disability specified in the pre-
ceding section, and no determinationor judgment be had of or upon
the title, right or action so to him accrued, his heirs may commence
such action after the time above limited for that purpose, and
within two years after his death. · 
SEC. 37. If the plaintiff shall have taken possession of the pre-
mises by virtue of any recovery in ejectment, such possession shall
not in any way be affected by the vacating of any judgment as
herein provided ; and if the defendant recover in any new trial
hereby authorized, he shall be entitled to a writ of possession in
the same manner as if he was rlaintiff. 
SEC. 38. Upon any new tria granted as herein provided, the de-
fendant may show any matters in bar of a recovery which he might 
show to entitle him to the possession of the premises if he were
plaintiff in the action. 
SEC. 39. The plaintiff recovering judgment in ejectment in any
of the cases in which such action may be maintained, shall also be 
entitled to recover damages against the defendant for the rents and
profits of the premises recovered. But if such action be brought
for the recovery of the dower, the plaintiff shall be entitled to re-
cover such damages as the court and jury may deem proper. 
SEC. 40. Instead of the action of trespass for mesne profits, the
plaintiff seeking to recover such damages shall, within one year 
after the docketing of the judgment, make and file a suggestion of
such claim; which shall be entered, with the proceedings thereon, 
upon the record of such judgments, or be attached thereto as a
continuation of the same. 
SEC. 41. Such suggestions shall be subtantially in the same form 
as is now in use, for a declaration in an action of assumpsit for
use and occupation, as near as may be, and it shall be served on
the defendant in the same manner herein before prescribed respect­
ing the service of a declaration in ejectment ; and a rule to plead
thereto shall be entered, and notice thereof given in the same man­
ner as upon declaration in personal actions. 
Sm. 42. The defendant may plead the general issue of non-as-
sumpsit, and under such plea may give notice of, or may plead 
specially any matters in bar of such claim, except such as were or 
might have been controverted in such action of ejectment; but he
may plead or give notice of a recovery by such defendant, or any
other person of the same premises, or of part thereof, subsequent '
to the verdict in such action of ejectment, in bar or in mitigation of 
the damages claimed by the plaintiff.
SEC. 43. If any issue of fact beJ' oined on such suggestion, it 
h 11 b , d d r 
tne as in other cases, an · such issue be found for the 
plaintiff, the same jury shall assess his damages to the amount of 
the mesne profits received by the defendant smce he entered into
possession of the premises, subject to the restrictions hereinafter 
contained.
SEc. 44. On the trial of such issue the plaintiff shall be required 
to establish, and the defendant may controvert, the time when such
defendant entered into possession of the premises, the time during
which he enjoyed the mesne profits thereof, and the value of such
profits, and the record of recovery in the action of ejectment shall 
not be evidence of such time.
SEc. 45. On such trial the defendant shall have the same right 
ff d th . h
to set o permanent improvements ma e on e premises, to t e 
amount of the plaintiff's claim as is now allowed by law. And
in estimating the plaintiff's damages, the value of the use by the
defendant of any improvements made by him, shall not be allowed
to the plaintiff. 
S£C. 46. The plaintiff shall not be entitled to recover the rents
and profits of the land so recovered, for any longer term than six 
years.
SEC. 47. If no issue of fact be joined on such suggestion, or if 
judgment thereon be rendered against the defendant by default, on 
demurrer or otherwise, a writ of inquiry to assess the value of
such mesne profits shall be issued, of the execution of whichsui·
ficient notice shall be given to the defendant or his attorney. 
SEC. 48. Upon the execution of such writ, the plaintiff shall be 
required to establish the same matters herein before required in 
the case of an issue bemg joined, and the defendant may in like
manner controvert the same, and make any set-off to which he 
shall be entitled, and the jury shall assess the damages in the same 
manner ; the same proceedings shall be had on such writ, and 
it shall be returned as in other cases, with the inquisition taken 
thereon.
SEC. 49. Upon such inquisition, or upon the verdict of the jurJ 
in the case of an issue being joined, the court shall render judg­ 
ment as in actions of assumpsit for use and occupation, which shall 
have the like effect in all respects.
SEC. 50. If the plaintiff in ejectment shall have died after is­ 
sue joined or judgment therein, his personal representatives may 
enter a suggestion of such death, of the granting letters testamea­
tary, or of administration to them, and may suggest their claim to
the mense profits of the premises recovered, in the same manner
and with the like effect as the deceased might have, <lone, and the
same proceedings in all respects shall be had thereon. 
SEc. 51. If the action be brought to recover the dower of any 
widow, whichshall not have been admeasured to her before the
commencement of such action, instead of a writ of possession be- 
ing issued, such plaintiff shall proceed to have her dower assigned
to lier in manner following: 
1. U _pon the filing of the record of judgment, the court, upon
the motion of the plaintiff, shall appoint three reputable and disin­
terested freeholders commissioners for theJurpose of making ad­
measurement of the dower of the plainti out of the lands de­
scribed in the record, and the commissioners so appointed shall
proceed immediately to the discharge of their duties: 
2. The report of the commissioners may be appealed from by
any party to the action: 
3. Upon the confirmation of the report of the commissioners, a 
writ of possession shall be issued to the sheriff of the proper coun­
ty, describing the premises assi~ed for the dower, and command­
ing the sheriff to put the plaintiff in possession thereof. 
SEC. 52. The costs and expenses incurred in such admeasure-
ment of dower, shall be subject to the order of the court.

the payment of any tax heretofore or hereafter lawfully assessed
thereon, or who shall claim title in fee simple, under or by virtue
of a deed from any other officer or person, and a suit, to recover
such lands and town lots or tenements, shall be instituted by any
person claiming title from any other source, on the trial of such
action, if the jury to whom the cause is submitted, shall find the
plaintiff entitled to such lands and tenements so claimed, a writ of
possession shall be awarded by the court, provided no permanent
and valuable improvements have been made on such lands and
tenements in good faith by the defendant, or those under whom
he claims since the execution of such deed, or sin.e the execution
of a like deed to those from whom he claims as aforesaid, and be-
fore the commencement of said suit. 
SEC. 2. If the defendant in any such suit, against whom a ver- 
Ii b r d hall 1 · th h 
( rct may e roun , s · c aim at e, or any person or persons
through whom he claims title, has in good faith, since the execu- 
tion of such deed or deeds, and before the commencement of said
suit, made valuable and permanent improvements on the said lands 
or town lots, the court in which the said cause is tried, shall cause 
an issue to be made up between the parties forthwith, in which the 
defendant in the original suit shall be plaintiff, and the plaintiff in
such suit defendant ; and a jury shall be empannelled at such 
terms, or at such subsequent term as the court shall appoint, to
try the issue so made up, and assess the value of said improve­
ments ; and if they find that the plaintiff is entitled to re­
cover any sum for or on account of such improvements, judgment
shall be rendered for such sum as they shall so assess and award. 
SEC. 3. If the plaintiff in the original suit shall elect to pay the
defendant in such suit the value of such improvements, as assessed
by the jury, with interest thereon from the time of such assess­
ment, and cost of the suit for the assessment of the value of such
improvements, and all taxes assessed upon said premises, and paid
by said defendant or those under whom he claims as aforesaid,
with interest thereon, within three years after the assessment of
such damages, and final judgment rendered thereon, the court shall
upon satisfactory proof of the payment, or the tender of the pa1- 
ment of the same, award a writ of possession; and if the said
plaintiff shall not pay or offer to pay the same within such time,
he shall be deemed to have abandoned his claim of title to the
premises in question, and he and all persons claiming under him,
shall be forever barred of a recovery of the premises, so claimed,
but shall, nevertheless, be liable for the costs of such suit, for the
assessment of such improvements ; and said defendant shall not be
liable to pay for the use or occupation of said premises during the
time any part of such sums shall remain unpaid.

cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners. 
SEc. 3. Such suit may be maintained by any person who has
an estate in possession in the lands of which partition is sought,
but not by one who has only an estate therein m remainder or re­ 
version.
SEC. 4. The bill for a partition or sale of any such lands, shall 
be verified by oath, and shall particularly describe the premises
sought to be divided, and shall set forth the rights and titles of all
persons interested therein, so far as the same are known to the
complainant, including the interest of any tenant for years, for
life, by the curtesy or in dower, and the persons entitled to the
reversion, remainder or inheritance after the termination of any 
particular estate therein, and every person who, by any contingen-
cy contained in any devise.grant or otherwise, may be or become, 
entitled to any beneficial interest in the premises.
SEC. 5. Every person having any such interest as aforesaid, 
whether in possession or otherwise, and every person entitled to
dower in such premises, if the same has not been admeasured, may 
be made a party to such suit.
SEc. 6. In case any one or more of such parties, or the share or 
quantity of interest of any of the parties be unknown to the com-
plainant, or be uncertain or contingent, or the ownership of the in-
heritance shall depend upon an executory devise, or the remainder
shall be a contingent remainder, so that such parties cannot be
named, the same shall be set forth in the bill. 
SEC. 7. It shall not be necessary in the first instance, to make
di ha  }" h · ·  
any ere itor vmg a ien on t e premises m question, or any part
thereof, by judgment, decree, mortgage or otherwise, a party to 
the proceedings, nor shall the partition of the premises alter, affect
or impair the lien of any such creditor, except in the cases provided
for in the next section. 
SEC. 8. When the lien is on the undivided interest or estate of
any of the parties, such lien, if partition be made of the premises, 
shall thereafter be a charge only on the share assigned to such
party, and such share shall be first charged with its just proportion
of the costs of the proceedings in partition, in preference to any
such lien. 
SEC. 9. But the comllainants may,at their electionj make every 
       
creditor havmg a spec1 c hen on the undivided interest or estate of
any-Of the parties, by mortgage or otherwise, a party to the pro-
ceedings; and in such case the bill shall set forth the nature of
every such lien or incumbrance. 
SEC. 10. Upon filing a bill in the circuit court, for the partition
or sale of any lands pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the 
def end ants, or such of them as reside in this state and can be found
therein, shall be served with a subprena to appear and answer the
bill, and the same may be taken as confessed, according to the
practice in courts of equity. 
SEC. 11. If any parties having an interest in such lands are un-
known, or if either of the known parties reside out of this state, or 
cannot be found therein, and such facts be made to appear to the
court by affidavit, an order may be made by the court, or judge
thereof, containing a sufficient description of the premises whereof
partition is sought, and requiring all parties interested to appear and
answer the bill by a day in such order to be specified, which order
shall be served persona1ly, or shall be published once in each
week successively in such paper as may be designated in such or-
der, and for such time as the court shall designate, not exceeding
three months. 
Ssc. 12. The proof of personal service, or of the publication of
such order, shall authorize an order of the court for taking the 
bill as confessed against all such unknown parties, and persons not
resident in this state, or not found therein, as shall not appear and
answer by the day mentioned in the order, or on such further day
as the court may appoint; and all such unknown parties as may 
appear shall be entitled to be made parties to the suit, and the bill
may be amended accordingly. 
SEC. 13. The general guardians residing in this state, of all mi-
nors and other persons under guardianship, who should be parties 
to such proceedings for partition, upon giving hond as hereinafter
directed, shall represent their respective wards therein, whether
such wards shall reside in or out of this state, and the court shall
appoint guardians for all such minors who shall be interested in
the premises, as have no general guardians in this state, for the
special purpose of taking charge of the interests of such minors,
in relation to the proceedings; and the acts of all such guardians
of minors, or others under guardianship, shall be binding on their
respective wards, and shall be as valid as if done by them respec­
tively when of full age, or under no legal incapacity. 
SEC. 14. Every such guardian shall give bond to the people of
this state, to be filed with the clerk of the court, in such penalty,
and with such surety as the court shall direct; conditioned for the 
faithful performance of the trust reposed in such ~rdian, and to
render a just and true account of his guardianship m all courts and
places when thereunto required, and for the observance of the
orders of the court in relation to the said trust. 
SEC. 15. When a bill shall be filed for the partition or sale of
any lands in pursuance of this chapter, and any of the defendants 
therein are minors, or other persons under guardianship, and the
general ~ardian, or person appointed guardian by the court, shall
fail to give the security herein before required, it shall be the duty
of the court, on the application of the complainants, to appoint the
clerk of said court the guardian of such minors or other pers6ns,
for the purpose of such partition, ancl to dispense with the securi­
ties hereinbefore required. 
Sec, 16. Any defendant may deny the joint tenancy, or tenancy
in common, of any co-defendant; and whenever the court shall 
deem it necessary, for the purpose of determining the rights of any
of the parties in the premises of which partition shall be sought, 
that any issue of fact between the parties, or any of them, should
be tried by a jury, such court may award a feigned issue for that
purpose, which shall be tried by a jury, and the verdict thereon be
returned as in other cases, and with the like effect. 
SEC. 17. Either before or after the trial of such issue, the court
may permit the bill and all subsequent proceedings to be amended 
so as to represent truly the rights claimed by any party; or so as
to make any person a defendant who shall have appeared in the
course of the proceedings to be interested in the premises, and who 
might originally have been made a defendant if his interest had
then existed or been known; but no person shall be so made a de­
fendant unless by his consent, without twenty days notice of the
motion to that effect being personally served on him, or published
once in each week successively for one month, in such paper as
the court may direct. . 
SEC. 18. After any such amendment, any party whose rights are
affected thereby, and who has not had an opportunity to sustain 
his claim, shall have the right to answer the bill, or to put in a 
further answer thereto, and to maintain his claim, as the circum-
stances of the case qiay render proper. 
Sec, 19. If the bill shall be taken as confessed by any of the
defendants, whether known or unknown, the court shall take proof
of the title of the complainants, and the complainants shall exhibit 
before such court proof of their title, and an abstract of the con-
veyances by whicli the same is he Id. 
SEC. 20. Upon the hearing of the cause, the ro'ltrt shall ascer- 
tam from tAe proofs so taken, in case of the bill being taken as
confessed; or from the bill aud answer, or pleadings and proofs, if 
the defendants appear and answer, and shall declare the rights,
titles and interests of the parties to such proceedings, complainants
as well as defendants, so far as the same shall have appeared; and
shall determine the ri~hta of the said parties in ettcn lands, and
shall decree that partition be made between such of them as &ila.U
have any right therein, according to such rights. 
S.:C. 21. If upon the hearing of the cause, the part or interest
of any parties who shall not have appeared and answered the bill,
whether known or unknown, in and to such premises, shall not 
have apfeared by the proofs in the cause, then the court ehaH de-
cree tha partition be made, so far as the rights or interests of the
parties who are known, and who hue appeared in the cause, have 
been ascertained, and the residue of the premises shall remain for
the parties whose interests have not been ascertained, subject to
division between them at any future time. 
Ss.c. 22. Upon making a decree for partition as provided in the
two last preceding sections, an order shall be entered referring it 
to a proper person to inquire into the situation of the premises, and
to report whether such premises, or any part of them are so cir- 
.cumstanced that a partition and division thereof amongst the parties
interested cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners. 
SEC. 23. If upon the coming in of the report of BUCh person the
court shall be satisfied that partition of the premises between the 
parties interested therein can be made without prejudice to the
owners, such court shall, by an order to be entered in its minutes,
appoint three discreet and disinterested freeholders, commissioners, 
to make the partition so decreed, according to the respective rights
and interests of the parties, as the same were ascertained and de-
termined by such court, and in such order the court shall desig-
nate the part or shares, if any, which shall remain undivided, for
the owners whose interests shall be unknown or ascertained. 
SEC. 24. If the persons so appointed commissioners, or either of
them shall die, resign, or neglect to eerve, the court may, from
time to time appoint others in their places. 
Sn:. 26. 1:he commissioners, before proceeding to the execu- 
ti.on of their duties, shall severally be sworn before any officer au-
thorized to administer oaths, honestly and impartially to execute
the trust reposed in them, and to make partition as directed by the
court; which oath shall be filed with the clerk of the court, on or
before the coming in of the report of such commissioners. 
S:r.c. 26. In making partition, the commissioners shall divide the
said real estate, and allot the several portions and shares thereof
to the respective parties, quality and quantity relatively consider- 
ed, according to the respective rights and interests of the parties 
so adjudged and decreed by the court, designating the several
shares and portions by posts, stones or other permanent monu­
ments; and they may, if necessary, employ a surveyor with the
necessary assistants, to aid them therein. 
SEC. 27. The commissioners shall make an ample report of their
proceedings, under the hands of any two of them, sr.ecifying
therein the manner of executing their trust, and descnbing the
land divided, and the shares allotted to each party, with conven­
ient certainty, and the items of their charges. 
SEC. 28. All the commissioners must meet together in the per­
formance of any of their duties, but the acts of a majority so met,
shall be valid. 
SEC. 29. The expenses of the commissioners, including the ex­
em­ 
ployed, shall be ascertained and allowed by the court; and the
amount thereof, together with such compensation as shall be al­
lowed to the commissioners by the court for their services, shall be
paid by the complainants, and shall be allowed to them as part of
the costs to be taxed. 
SEC. 30. On good cause shown, the court may set aside the re- 
port, and commit the case to the same, or appoint new commis­
sioners, as often as may be necessary, who shall proceed in like 
manner as herein before directed.
SEC. 31. Upon the confirmation of the report of any commis­ 
sioners by the court, a decree shall thereupon be entered, that such
partition be firm and effectual forever, and such decree shall be 
binding and conclusive,
1. On all parties named therein, and their legal representatives, 
who shall, at the time, have any interest in the premises divided,
as owners in fee, or as tenants for 7ears, or as entitled to the re­ 
version, remainder or inheritance o such premises2 after the ter­
mination of any particular estate therein; or who, by any contin­
gency contained in any will or grant, or otherwise, may be or 
become entitled to any beneficial interest in the premises; or who
shall have any interest in any undivided share of the premises, as 
tenant for years, for life, by the curtesy, or in dower :
2. On all persons interested in the premises, who may be un­ 
known, to whom notice shall have been given by personal service
or by publishing the same as is herein before directed : and, 
3. On all other persons claiming from such parties or persons,
or either of them. 
SEC. 32. But such decree and partition shall not affect any ten- 
 }  th
ants, or persons havmg c aims as tenants, in dower, by e curtesy 
or for life, to the whole of the premises which shall be the subject 
of such partition ; nor shall any such decree and partition preclude 
any person, except such as are specified in the last preceding sec­
tion, from claimmg any title to the rremises in question, or from 
controverting the title or interest o the parties, between whom
such partition shall be made. 
SEC. 33. If the person to whom reference shall be made as
herein before provided, shall report to the court that the lands or 
tenements of which division and partition is sought, are so situat- 
ed, or that any distinct tract, lot or portion thereof, is so situated,
that a partition and di vision thereof amongst the persons interest-
ed therein, cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners;
and if the court shall be satisfie I that such report is just and cor-
rect, the court m~y thereupon make an order that the sheriff sell
the premises so situated, at public auction, to the highest bidder. 
SEc. 34. The court shall direct, in such order, the terms of
credit which may be allowed, for any portions of the purchase~°'
money of which it shall think proper to direct the investment, and
for such portions of such purchase money, as are required by the
provisions hereinafter contained, to be invested for the benefit of
any unknown owners, any infants, any parties out of the state, or
any tenants for life, in dower, or by the curtesy. 
SEC. 35. The portions of the purchase money for which credit
shall be allowed, shall always be secured at interest, by a mort-
gage of the premises sold, by a bond of the purchaser, and by such
other security as the court shall prescribe. 
SEC. 36. The sheriff may take separate mortgages and other
securities, for such convenient shares or portions of the purchase 
money, as are directed by the court to be invested, in the name of
the clerk of the court in whose office the original bill for a parti-
tion was filed, and his successors in office; and for such shares as
any known owner of full age shall desire to have so invested, in
the name of such owner. 
SEC. 37. Upon such sales being confirmed, as hereinafter men-
tioned, the said sheriff shall deliver such mortgages and other se- 
curities, to the clerk of the court, or to the known owners whose
shares were so invested. 
SEc. 38. Before making any order for the sale of the said pre-
mises, where the creditors having specific liens shall not have
been made parties, the court shall direct the complainant to amend
his bill, by making every creditor having a specific lien on theun-
divided interest or estate of any of the parties, by mortgage or
otherwise, a party to the proceedings. 
SEC. 39. If it shall appear by the proceedings on such bill, or
by such report, that there are any existing incumbrances upon the
estate or interest in the premises, of any party named in the pro-
ceedings in the suit, the court shall, in the order of sale, direct the
sheriff to bring into court and fay to the clerk, the portion of the
moneys arising from the sale o the estate and interest of such par-
ty, after deducting the portion of the costs, charges and expenses
to which it shall be liable. 
SEc. 40. Such party may apply to the court to order such mon-
eys, or such part thereof as he shall claim, to be paid to him; 
which application shall be accompanied,
1. By his own affidavit, stating the true amount actually due on 
each incumbrance, the owner of such incumbrance, and his resi­
dence, as far as known to such party: 
2. By proof by affidavit, of the due service of a notice on each
owner of any incumbrance, of the intention to make such applica­
tion, at least fourteen days previously. If such owner reside in
this state, such notice shall be served personal1y, or if he be absent 
from his residence, by leaving a copy there, ~ith some person of 
his household of proper age. IC such owner reside out of this
state, such notice may be served on him personally, thirty days pre­
viously, or by publishing the same in such paper as the court may
direct, three weeks successively, once in each week. 
SEc. 41. Upon such application and proof of notice, the court
shall froceed to hear the proofs and allegations of the :parties; 
and i any question of fact shall arise, which, in the opinion of
the court, cannot be satisfactorily determined without a trial by
jury, the court shall award a feigned issue, to be tried as in other
cases, and the costs of such trial shall be paid by the party failing,
which payment shall be enforced by attachment, as in other
cases. 
SEC. 42. When the amount of existing incumbrances shall have
been ascertained, the court shall proceed to order a distribution or
the moneys so brought into and remaining in court, among the sev­
eral creditors having such incumbrances, according to the priority
thereof respectively. 
SEc. 43. The clerk of the court by whom any such incumbrance
shall be paid off, shall \>rocure satisfaction thereof to be acknowl­
edged, in the form required by law, and shall cause such incum­
brance to be duly satisfied or canceled of record, and shall defray
the expenses thereof, out of the portion of the moneys in court
belonging to the party by whom such incumbrance was payable. 
SEc. 44. The proceedings to ascertain and settle the amount of
incumbrances as herein provided, shall not affect any other party 
in such suit for partition, nor delay the paying over or investing
the moneys to or for the benefit of any party, upon whose es­
tate in the premises there shall not appear to be any existing in­
cumbrances. 
SEC. 45. Whenever the estate or any tenant in dower\ or by the
curtesy or for life, in the whole or any part or share of the premi­
ses in question, has been admitted by the parties, or ascertained by
the court, to be existing at the time of the order for such sale, and
the person entitled to such estate has been made a party to the
proceedings, the court shall first consider and determine under all
the circumstances of the case, whether such estate ought to be ex­ 
cepted from such sale, or whether the same should be sold, and in
making such determination, regard shall be had to the interests of
all parties. 
SEc. 46. Ir a sale of the premises, including such estate shall
be ordered, the estate and interest of every such tenant or personf
shall pass thereby, and the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shal
hold such premises free and discharged from all claims by virtue
of any such estate or interest, whether the same be to any undivi­
ded share of a joint tenant, or tenant in common, or to the whole
or any part of the premises sold. , 
SEC. 47. Upon such sale being made of any such interest or es­
tate, the court shall direct the payment of such sum in gross, out 
of the proceeds thereof, to the person entitled to such estate in
dower, tenancy by the curtesy, or. tenancy for life, as shall be 
deemed upon the principles of law applicable to annuities, a rea­
sonable satisfaction for such estate or interest, and which the per­
son so entitled shall consent to accept in lieu thereof, by an instru- 
merit under seal, duly acknowledged or proved in the manner that
deeds are required to be acknowledged or proved, to entitle them-----
to be recorded.
SEC. 48. In case no· such consent is given at or before the com- 
ing in of the report of sale by the sheriff, then the court shall as-
certain and determine what proportion of the proceeds of such sale, 
after deducting all expenses, will be a just and reasonable sum to
be invested for the benefit of the person entitled to such estate or
interest in dower, by the curtesy or for life, and shall order the 
same to be btought mto court for that purpose.
SEC. 49. The proportions of the proceeds of such sale to be in- 
vested, shall be ascertained and determined, in the several cases,
as follows: 
1. If an estate in dower shall have been included in such order
of sale, its proportion shall be one-third of the proceeds of the sale
of the premises, or of the sale of the undivided share in such premi-
ses, upon which such claim of dower existed : 
2. If an estate by the curtesy, or other estate for life, shall be
included in the order of sale, its proportion shall be the whole pro-
ceeds of the sale of the premises, or of the sale of the undivided
share thereof, in which such estate shall be: 
And in all cases, the proportion of the expenses of the proceed­
ings shall be deducted from the proceeds of such sale. 
SEc. 50. If the persons entitled to any such estate in dower,
by the curtesy or for life, be unknown, the court shall take order
for the protection of the rights of such persons, in the same man-
ner, as far as may be, as if they were known and had appeared. 
hi 
SEC. 51. The sheriff shall give notice of any sale to be made by 
f
h 
. d i h . 'dblborllt: 
m, or t e same time, an m t e same manner as IS require y 
Jaw on sales of real estate by sheriffs on execution.
Su. 52. The terms of such sale shall be made known at the 
time, and if the premises consist of distinct lots, tracts or parcels,
they shall be sold separately. 
SEC. 53. No such sheriff, nor any person for his benefit, shall
be interested in the purchase, nor directly or indirectly purchase 
any of the premises sold; nor shall any guardian of any infant
party in such suit, purchase, or be interested in the purchase of 
any lands being the subject of such suit, except for the benefit or
in behalf of such infant; and all sales contrary to the provisions of
this section shall be void. 
SEC. 54. After completing such sale the sheriff shall report the
same to the court, with a description of the different parcels of land
sold to each purchaser, the name of such purchaser, and the price
bid by him, which report shall be filed in the court. . 
81:c. 55. If such sales be approved and confirmed by the court,
an order shall be entered directing the sheriff to execute convey-
ances pursuant to such sales; which such sheriff shall be authorized
to do upon the entry of such order. 
SEc. 56. Such conve.Yances so executed shall be recorded in the
county where the premises are situated, and shall be a bar, both in
law and equity, against all persons interested in any way, who shall
have been named as parties in the said proceedings, and against all 
such parties as were unknown, if notice of the Qrder to appear and 
answer shall have been given by such publication or service of no­
tice as is herein before directed, and against all other persons
claiming from such parties, or either of them. 
SEC. 57. Such conveyances shall also be a bar against all per­
sons having specific liens on any undivided share or interest there­
in, who shall have been made parties to the proceedings; but no
creditor having any such specific lien shall be affected by such sale
or conveyance, unless he shall have been made a party to the pro­ 
ceedings.
SEC. 58. The costs and expenses of the proceedings shall be de­ 
ducted from the proceeds of every sale made by the sheriff', and
shall be by him in the first instance paid to the complainants or 
their solicitor.
SEC. 59. The proceeds of every sale, after deducting the costs, 
shall be divided among the parties whose rights and interests shall
have been sold, in proportion to their respective rights in the pre­
mises; and the shares of such of the said parties as are of full age
shall be paid to them or their legal representatives by the sheriff,
or shall be brought into court for their use. · 
8100. 60. When any of such known parties are infants, the court
may in its discretion, direct the shares of such infant to be paid
over to the general guardian, or to be invested in permanent secu-
rities at interest, in the name and for the benefit of such infant. 
SEC. 61. Where any of the parties whose interests have been
sold are absent from the state, without legal representatives in this 
state, or are not known or named in the proceedings, the court
shall direct the shares of such parties to be invested in permanent
securities at interest, for the benefit of such parties, until claimed
by them or their legal representatives. 
SEC. 62. Where the proceeds of a sale belonging to any tenant
in dower, or by the curtesy, or for life, shall be brought into court 
as hereinbefore directed, the court shall direct the same to be in­
vested in permanent securities at interest, so that such interest shall 
annually be paid to the parties entitled to such estate, during their 
lives respectively.
Sze. 63. The court may, in its discretion, require all or any of 
the parties, before they shall receive any share of the moneys ari­
sing from such sales, to give security to the satisfaction of such
court to refund the said share, 1vith interest thereon, in case it shall
thereafter appear that such _party was not entitled thereto. 
SEC. 64. When any security is directed to be taken by the court,
or any investment to be made, or any security shall be taken by a 
sheriff, on the sale of any real estate as hereinbefore directed, ex­
cept where provision shall be made for taking the same in the name
of any known owner, the bonds, mortgages, or other evidences
thereof shall be taken in the name of the clerk of the court in whose
office the original bill was filed, and his successors in office, who
shall hold the same by virtue of his office, and shall deliver them 
to his successor.
SEC. 66. Such clerk shall receive the interest or principal of anv 
sums as they become due, and apply or re-invest the same, accord-
ing to the circumstances of the case, as the court shall direct; and 
shall, once in eYery year, render to the court an account in writing 
., 
and on oath, of all moneys received by him, and of the application
thereof. 
SEc. 66. All investments, or re-investments, under the provi-
sions of this chapter, shall be made on bond and mortgage upon 
unincumbered real estate, of at least double the value of such in-
vestment, exclusive of buildings, or in other equivalent security;
and no such security, bond, mortgage, or other evidence of such
investment, shall be discharged, transferred, or impaired, by any
act of the clerk, without the order of the court entered in the mi-
nutes thereof. 
SEC. 67. Any person interested in such investment may, with
the leave of the court, prosecute the same in the name of the ex- 
isting clerk, and no suit shall be abated by the death, removal from
office, or resignation of the clerk to whom such securities or evi-
dences were executed, or of any of his successors.· 
SEC. 68. When a decree confirming the partition made by any
.  h 11 b d id d · hi h h 
comnnssioners, s a e entere as p1ov1 e m t s c al>ter, t e
court shall also adjudge and decree that each of the parties con- 
cerned therein, other than the complainants, pay to such complain-
ants a pro.portion of the costs and charges of the proceedings, to
be ascertained by the court, according to the respective rights of
the parties, and the proportion of such costs and charges assessed
upon the unknown owners, to be chargeable on the part remaining
undivided; and upon such decree execution may issue as in other
cases, and may be levied on the property of the parties respectively
charged with such costs, and upon any share or part of the pre-
mises allotted on any such division to any owner unknown, or not
named, and upon every portion remaining undivided, for the pro-
portion adjudged to be paid by such owners, or chargeable to the
part remaining undivided. 
SEC. 69. A sale of the premises of such owner unknown, upon
such execution, shall be as valid as if such owner had been named
in the proceedings, and in such execution. 
SEC. 70. If a bill for partition shall be dismissed, or the suit
shall be discontinued, the complainants shall pay costs, to be col- 
lected as in other cases.
SEC. 71. Any of the parties to a suit for the partition or sale of 
any premises under the provisions of this chapter, and any party
interested in the premises, though not named in the proceedings,
may, jointly or separately, and without the consent of any co-com­
plamant or co-defendant, appeal from any decree or order of the
said court, upon any such proceedings, within the same time, and
under the like regulations as in other cases. 
SEc.72. Whenever it shall aipear satisfactorilv to the court, by 
   ,(  
due proof, that any mfant hol s real estate m joint tenancy, or m 
common, or in any other manner which would authorize his being 
made a party to a suit in partition, and that the interest of such
infant, or of any other person concerned therein, requires that par-
tition of such estate should be made, such court may direct and
authorize the general guardian of such infant to agree to a division
thereof, or to a sale of such premises, or of such part thereof, as in
the opinion of the court shall be incapable of partition, or as shall
be most for the interest of such infant to be sold. 
SEC. 73. Such guardian shall report to the court, on oath, the
partition or sale so made by him, and if the same be approved and
confirmed by the court, an order shall be entered authorizing such 
guardian to execute conveyances of the right of such infant to such
part of the said estate as shall have been sold, to the purchaser
thereof; or to execute releases of the rights of such infant to such
part of the said estate, as in the division falls to the shares of the
other joint tenants, or tenants in common. 
SEC. 7 4. Such deeds shall be as valid and effectual to convey the
share and interest of such infant, as if the same had been executed
and duly acknowledged by such infant after arriving at full age;
and in case of the sale of any part of such estate, the infant shall
be deemed a ward of the court, and such order shall be taken as
the court may direct, for securing, investing and applying the pro­
ceeds of the sale, and for requiring security from the guardian for

ment shall not be conclusive against the defendant, and such exe-
cution shall only authorize the officer to whom it is directed, to
sell the property attached in such suit. 
SEC. 23. In the case specified in the last section, the attorney
issuin~ the execution, shall indorse thereon or annex thereto, a de­
scription of the property so attached, with a direction to the offi­
cer to sell the same, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to sat­
isfy the execution, and not to levy the same or any part thereof
upon any other property. 
SEc. 24. If a bond shall have been given to the officer, condi­
tioned for the payment of the judgment, as provided in the thir­ 
teenth and fourteenth sections of this chapter, and judgment be
rendered in favor of the plaintiff, it shall not be necessary to issue 
any execution upon such judgment, to entitle such plaintiff to sue
on such bond. 
SEC. 25. When any of the property taken in attachment shall con-
' f h bl h ' d h f 
sist o pens a e property, t e court, or any JU ge t ereo , may
make an order, directing such property to be sold, and the money
arising from such sale to be brought into court, to abide the order
of such court . 
. SEc. 26. Upon such order fo~ a sale being made, th~ officer hav- 
mg such property, shall advertise and sell the same, m the same
manner that personal property is required to be advertised and sold on 
execution, and shall deposite the proceeds thereof with the clerk 
to whose office the attachment is required to be returned.
SF.C. 27. If the plaintiff recover judgment, the court may order 
such money to be paid to the plaintiff thereon; but if judgment
"be rendered against the plaintiff, or the suit be discontinued, or 
the attachment dismissed, the court shall order such money to
be paid to the defendant, or person entitled thereto. 
SEC. 28. Whenever judgment shall be rendered against the
plaintiff in attachment, the court shall, upon the request of the de- 
fendant impannel a jury, which shall proceed to assess the dama ·
ges sustained by such defendant by reason of the taking, detention
or sale of any property attached under the provisions of this chap-
ter, and the court shall render judgment thereon against such
plaintiff. 
SEC. 29. The practice in actions commenced by attachment,
shall be the same in all respects, as in personal actions commenced 
by summons, as near as may be, except as otherwise provided by
law. 
SEC. 30. Wllf~n two or more persons are jointly indebted as
joint obligors, partners, or otherwise, the attachment may be issued 
against the separate or joint estates or property of such joint debt-
ors, or any of them, and the same proceedings shall be had as here- 
.inbefore prescribed. 
SEC. 31. If any estate which shall be attached shall be subject
to a mortgage, or other incumbrance, and the mortgage sha\l be 
satisfied or the incumbrance removed before the sale on the execu-
tion, such estate may be sold on such execution in the same man-
ner and with the same effect as if the mortgage or other incum- 
brance had never existed.
SEC. 32. If the plaintiff, or any one in his behalf, shall make an 
affidavit, stating that he verily believes that any person, (naming~~:~:: 
him) ,has properti, credits or effects, (describing the same) in his
possession belongmg to the defendant, or is indebted to the defend- 
ant, and deliver the same to the officer having the writ, the officer
if he cannot attach such property and get possession thereof, &ilali
serve such writ and affidavit upon such person, by giving him a 
copy thereof, with a written notice that he appear in court at the
return of such writ, 
SEC. 33. From the day of such service, tHe person so notified as
garnishee shall stand liable to such plaintiff in attachment to the 
amount of the property, moneys and credits in his hands, and debts
due or to become due from him to said defendant, and shall at- 
tend the court in accordance with such notice, and answer under 
oath all questions put to him touching the property, credits, and
effects of the defendant in said garnishee's possession or within his
knowledge, and as to all debts d.ue or to become due from him to
the defendant. 
SEC. 34. If such garnishee do not appear in court as hereinbe­
fore required, the court may compel his appearance by attachment, 
and if appearing he shall neglect or ref use to answer all proJ>er
questions propounded to him, he may be punished by fine or im­ 
prisonment, or both, at the discretion of the court ; and the court
may also render a judgment against him for the amount of the
plaintiff's demand, when the same shall be ascertained. 
SEC. 35. If upon the answer of the garnishee, no issue is made
up between the plaintiff' and garnishee as hereinafter provided, and 
it shall appear from such answer that the garnishee had no pre­
perty or effects of the defendant, and was not indebted to him at 
the time he was notified, or that he delivered up to the officer at
that time all of the property of the defendant in his possession, or
paid to the officer the amount of his indebtedness t'o the defend­
ant, then such garnishee shall recover judgment against the plain­
tiff for his fees for travel and attendance, which sliall be the same
as those allowed to witnesses. 
SEC. 36. If the answer of the garnishee shall not be satisfacto­
ry to the plaintiff, an issue shall be immediately made up between 
the plaintiff and garnishee, which shall be for trial at the next
term after the plaintiff shall have obtained judgment against the 
defendant, and in case no such judgment shall be obtained, the
garnishee shall recover costs as above stated. All issues between
the plaintiff and garnishee shall be tried, and judgment thereon
rendered, and costs awarded and execution issued in the same man­
ner and with the like effect as in other personal actions, except
that the judgment against the garnishee, shall not be for a greater
amount than that rendered against the defendant. In case the an­
swer of the garnishee shall be satisfactory to the plaintiff, and it shall
appear by it that he was indebted to the defendant, or had in hia 
possession the property and effects of the defendant, the court, af­
ter judgment shall have been rendered against the defendant,
shall render judgment against the garnishee according to the mer­
its of the case. 
SEC. 37. If in any case where an officer has a writ of attachment
against property, there is any reasonable doubt as to the ownership 
of the property, or as to its liability so be taken on the attach-
ment, the officer may require sufficient security to indemnify him
for attaching such property.

from collecting or receiving any debts or demands, and from pay- 
iqg out, or in any way transferring or delivering to an;r person 
any of the moneys, property or effects of such corporation, until
such court shall otherwise order. 
SEC. 10. Such injunction may be issued on the application of'
the attorney general in behalf of this state, or on the application 
of any creditor or stockholder of such corporation, upon bill or
petition, filed for that purpose, and upon due proof of any of the
facts in the last section required, to authorize the issuing of the
same. Whenever such injunction shall issue against any bank,
for any violation of its charter, on the application of any creditor,

ties to the bill or petition, either on the filing thereof, or in any
subsequent stage of the proceedings, whenever it shall become ne­
cessary to enforce such liability. 
SEC. 14. If any creditor of a corporation desire to make such di­
rectors or stockholders parties to the suit, after a decree therein
against the corporation, he may do so, on filing a supplemental bill
against them, founded upon such decree, and if such decree was ren­
dered in a proceeding instituted by the attorney general, such cre­
ditor may, on his application, be made complainant therein, and
may, in like manner, make the directors and stockholders sought
to be charged, defendants in such suit. 
· SEC. 15. Whenever any creditor of a col'{>oration shall seek to
charge the directors, trustees, or other superintending officers of 
such corporation, or the stockholders thereof, on account of any

any circuit court, which shall posse~ jurisdiction to enforce such 
liability.

when necessary, shall cause an account to be taken of the proper­
ty, and debts due to and from such corporation, and shall appoint
one or more receivers, who shall possess all the powers conferred, 
and be subject to all the obligations imposed on receivers in
case of the \'Oluntary dissolution of a corporation. 
SEC. 17. But if on the coming in of the answer, or upon the
taking of any such account, it shall appear that such corporation
is insolvent, and that it has no property or effects to satisfy such
creditor, the court may proceed, without appointing any receiver,
to ascertain the respective liabilities of such directors, and stock­
holders, and enforce the same, by its decree as in other cases.

cation to restrain a corporation, or upon any such bill filed 
against directors or stockholders, the court shall cause a just
and fair distribution of the property of such corporation, and
of the J?roceeds thereof, to be made among its fair and honest cre-
ditors, m the order and in the proportions prescribed in the case of 
a voluntary dissolution of a corporation.
SEc. 19. In all cases in which the directors or other officers of 
a corporation, or the stockholders thereof, shall have been made
parties to a suit in which a decree shall be rendered, if the pro- 
perty of such corporation shall be insufficient to discharge its
debts, the court shall proceed to compel each stockholder to
pay in the amount due and remaining unpaid on the shares of stock
held by him, or so much thereof as shall be necessary to satisfy the
debts of the company. 
SEc. 20. If the debts of the company shall remain unsatisfied, the
court shall proceed to ascertain the respective liabilities of the di- 
rectors or other officers, and of the stockholders, and to decree
the amount payable by each, and enforce. such decree as in other
cases. 
SEC. 21. Upon any application to the court having jurisdiction
in any of the cases provided in this chapter, such court may com- 
pel such corporation to discover any stock, property, things in ac-
tion, or effects, a1leged to belong or to have belonged to it, the
transfer and disposition thereof, and the consideration, and all the
circumstances of such disposition. 
SEC. 22. Every officer, agent, or stockholder, of any corporation,
a~nst which proceedings shall be instituted, according to the pro- 
visions of this chapter, and every person to whom it shall be al-
leged that any transfer of property or effects of such corporation
has been made, or in whose possession or control any such porper-
ty or effects shall be alleged to be, may be compelled, in the dis-
cretion of the court, to answer a bill filed to obtain any discovery
in the preceding section specified, notwithstanding such answer
may expose the corporation of which he is a member, to a forfei-
ture of its corporate rights, or any of them. 
Ssc. 23. The answers of the officers and agents of any corpo-
ration, shall be evidence against the corporation, in the same man-
ner, and to the same extent as if such answers had been given up-
on an examination of such officers or agents, as witnesses in the
cause, and such officers or agents may subsequently be examined
as witnesses by either party, under the order of the court, but no
such answer shall be compelled, unless by special order of the 
court. 
SEC. 24. Neither the answer of any such officer or agent nor his
. h b . . h ll 1 d 
testimony upon any sue su sequent examination, s a be use

proceeding agaainst him.

shall be made against any corporation, its directors or other super- 
intending officers, or its stockholders, according to the provisions of
this chapter, the court may, by injunction, on the application of
either.party, and at any stage of the proceedings, restrain all pro-
deedings at law, by any creditor against the defendants in such 
suit; and whenever it shall appear necessary or proper, may order 
notice to be published in such manner as the court shall direct, re­
quiring all the creditors of such corporation to exhibit their claims
and become parties to the suit, withm a reasonable time, not less
than six months from the first publication of such order, and in de­
fault thereof, to be precluded from all benefit of the decree, which
shall be made in such suit, and from any distribution which shall
be made under such decree.

case of default an attachment may be issued against him of courfe,
upon being allowed by a judge of the court, or by an officer au-
thorized to perform the duties of such judge, upon proof of such 
default ; and in such allowance the cause of issuing the same shall
be stated, and that the defendant is not to be discharged upon bail,
or in any other manner but by the order of the court. 
SEC, 18. The officer to whom such last mentioned attachment
shall be delivered, shall execute the same by arresting and keeping 
the defendant in his custody, bringing him personally before
the court, and detaining him in such custody until the order of the 
court.
SEC. 19. When any defendant arrested upon an attachment shall 
have been brought into court, or shall have appeared therein, the
court shall cause interrogatories to be filed, specifying the facts
and circumstances alleged against the defendant, and requiring his
answer thereto; to which the defendant shall make written answers,
on oath, within such reasonable time as the court shall allow, and
the court may receive any affidavits .or other proofs contradictory
of the answers of the defendant, or in confirmation thereof; and
upon the original affidavits, such answers and such subsequent
proof, shall determine whether the defendant has been guilty of
the misconduct alleged. 
Ssc. 20. If the court shall adjudge the defendant to have been
guilty of the misconduct alleged, and that the misconduct was 
· calculated to, or actually did defeat, impair, impede or prejudice
the rights or remedies of any party in a cause or matter depend­
ing in such court, it shall proceed to impose a fine, or to imprison
him, or both, as the nature of the case shall require. 
SEC. 21. If an actual loss or injury bas been produced to any 
party bb the misconduct alleged, the court shall order a sufficient 
.I    
sum to e paid by the defendant to such party, to indemnify him
and to satisfy his costs and expenses, instead of imposing a fine
upon such defendant, and in such case the payment and accept-
ance of such sum shall 1'e an absolute bar to any action by such
aggrieved party to re-over damages for sucn injury or loss. 
- SEC. 22. In all cases other than that specified in the preceding
section, the fine shall not exceed two hundred and. fifty ·.:ollars over

a conviction shall be had on such indictment shall take into con­
sideration the punishment before inflicted, in forming its sen­
tence. 
SEC. 27. If the defendant against whom an attachmer.t shall
have been issued and returned served, do not appear on the return 
day thereof, the court may either award another attachment, or
may order the bond taken on the arrest, to be prosecuted, or
both. 
SEC. 28. Such order shall operate as an assignment of the bond
to any aggrieved party who shall be authorized by the court to pros­
ecute the same, and such party maJ· maintain an action thereon in
his own name, as assignee of the sheriff or officer to whom the same
was siven, in the same manner as in other actions on bonds, with
condition to perform covenants other than the payment of money. 
SEC. 29. The measure of the damages to be assessed in such
action shall be the extent of the loss or injury sustained by such 
aggrieved party, by reason ot the misconduct for which the attach­
ment was issued, and his costs and expenses in prosecuting such 
attachment. 
SEc. 30. If there be no party aggrieved by the misconduct for
which the attachment was issued, the court, in case the defendant 
shall fail to appear, according to the condition of the bond taken
on the arrest, shall order the same to be prosecuted by the attor- 
ney general, or by the district attorney for the county in which the
bond was taken, in the name of the officer who took such bond. 
SEc. 31. In such case the whole penalty of the bond shall be
forfeited and recovered, and from the money collected thereon the 
court shall order such sum to be paid to the party prosecuting the
attachment as the court ordering the prosecution shall think pro­
per, to satisfy the costs and expenses incurred by him, and to com­
pensate him for any injury he may have sustained by the miscon­
duct for which such attachment was issued; and the residue of
such moneys shall be paid into the state treasury, to the credit of
the school fund. 
SEC. 32. If, on the return of an execution duly issued upon any
judgment obtained upon such bond, it shall appear that the sure­ 
ties taken therein were, at the time of taking them, insufficient, and
that the officer taking them had reasonable ground to doubt their
sufficiency, he shall be liable in an action on the case to the party
aggrieved, who may have prosecuted such suit for the amount of
the judgment recovered by him, and for his costs and expenses in
such suit; or if such suit was brought by the attorney general or a
district attorney, an action on the case may in like manner be
brought by them in the name of this state, for the amount of the
judgment so recovered; and the same disposition of the moneys
collected in such action on the case against such officer, shall be
made, as directed in the preceding section. 
SEC. 33. Whenever, by t'-e provisions of this chapter, an officer 
is required to keep any person arrested upon attachment in actual
custody, and to bring him personally before any court, the inability 
from sickness or otherwise of such person to attend such court
personally shall be a suffcient excuse for not bringing him before
such court; nor shall any officer be required, in any case, to con-
fi
d
hm 
ne any person arreste upon an attac ent, to answer ror mis-
conduct, in any prison, or otherwise to restrain him of his personal
liberty, except so far as shall be necessary to secure his personal
attendance.

the action, or some one in his behalf, shall execute a bond to the
sheriff, or other officer to whom the writ is directed, with the addi- 
tion of his name of office, with sufficient sureties, who shall swear
that they are each worth the amount o{ the penalty of the bond,
over and above all debts, or who shall be accepted by the defend­
ant, in a penalty at least double the value of the property specified
in the writ; which value shall be ascertained by the oath of one or
more disinterested witnesses, to be sworn and examined by the
shemff. Such bond shall be conditioned that the plaintiff will pro­
secute the suit to effect, and without delay; and that if the defend­
ant recover judgment against him in the action, he will return the
same property, if return thereof be adjudged, and will pay to the
defendant all such sums of money as may be recovered against
him, by such defendant in the said action, for any cause whatever. 
SEc. 9. Upon the receipt of the bond above required, the sheriff
shall forthwith proceed to deliver possession of the property named
therein, to the plaintiff or his authorized agent. 
SEC. 10. The summons shall be served on the defendant by de-
livering to him personally, if he can be found, a copy of the writ;
if he cannot be found, it may be served by leaving the same at his
usual place of abode, with his wife, or with some person of proper 
age.
SEC. 11. If the property to be replevied, or any part thereof, be 
secured or concealed in any dwelling-house, or other building or
enclosure, the officer shall publicly demand deliverance thereof, 
and if the same be not delivered by the defendant. or some other
person, he shall cause such house, building or enclosure, to be
broken open, and shall make replevin according to the writ, and if 
necessary he shall take to his assistance the power of his county.
SEC. 12. If the goods and chattels, specified in any writ of re­ 
plevin, have not been delivered to the plaintiff, he may proceed in 
the action for the recovery of the said goods and chattels, or the
value thereof. 
SEC. 13. The sheriff shall return the writ immediately after the
service thereof, and shall transmit therewith the bond to him deli- 
vered.
SEC. 14. The sheriff shall state in his return fully in what man- 
ner he has executed the writ.

appearance of such defendant, and thereafter proceedings shall be

SEC. 16. The plaintiff shall declare within ten days after the
return of the writ, and serve a copy of the declaration upon the'° 
defendant, his agent or attorney, if to be found.
SEC. 17. The defendant shall plead to such declaration within 
twenty days after service upon him, as above stated, of a copy

after the commencement thereof, and shall not be continued on 
the part of the plaintiff except for the same causes required to be
shown for a second continuance in other cases, and on the part of
the defendant for the same causes required in other cases. 
SEC. 20. Where the original taking of the goods is not com-
plained of, but the action is founded on the wrongful detention of:«:'°
such goods, the declaration shall be conformed to the writ, and
shall allege with requisite certainty of time, place and value, 'that
the defendant received the property described in the writ from the
plaintiff, or from some other person, ( naming him, if his name be
known,) to be delivered to the plaintiff, when thereunto afterwards
requested; and that the defendant, although requested so to do,
has not delivered the same to the plaintiff, but refuses so to do,
and detains the sa~e property to the damage of the waintiff; and
where the action is founded on the wrongful taking and detention 
of the property, but such property, for an~ reason, shall not have
been replevied and delivered to the plaintiff, the declaration shall 
not only allege such wrongful taking, but shall also allege that
the defendant continues to detain such property. 
SEC. 21. It shall not be necessary for the plaintiff to state in his
declaration a place certain, within the town or village, as that 
where the property was taken.
Ssc, 22. When the wrongful taking of the property described 
in the declaration is complained of therein, the plea of the general
issue shall be as heretofore, that the defendant did not take the 
goods and chattels described in the declaration, or any of themvin
manner and form as the plaintiff has alleged. 
SEC. 23. When the action is founded on the wrongful detention
of the goods, and the original taking is not complained of, the pJea
of the general issue Aha II be, that the defendant does not detain
the goods and chattels specified in the declaration, or any part
thereof, in manner and form as therein alleged; and such plea
shall put in issue, not only the detention of such goods and chat-
tels, but also the property of the plaintiff therein. 
SEC. 24. With the plea, denying the taking or detention of the
property claimed, the defendant may give notice of any matters, 
which if properly pleaded by a vowry, cognizance or plea, would 
be a bar to the action, and which, if the goods have been replevied,
would entitle him to a return thereof; and he may give such mat- 
ters in evidence on the trial, in the same manner, and with the like
effect, as if the same had been so pleaded. 
SEC. 25. The plaintiff may plead in answer to any plea as many
several matters as he shall think necessary for his defence, and 
may give evidence of any matters in answer to defendant's notice,
that he may find necessary to his defence. 
SEc. 26. If upon the tnal of the cause the verdict be in favor of 
the plaintiff, the same jury shall assess the damages which he has 
sustained by the unjust taking or detention of the property reple­
vied; but if the judgment pass for the plaintiff by default, or upon 
an issue of law, a writ of inquiry shall be awarded to the sheriff of
the proper county, to ascertain his damages for such caption and
detention. 
SEC. 27. It shall also be the duty of the jury upon such trial of
the cause, or on the execution of such writ of inquiry, as the case
may be, to assess the value of the goods and chattels specified in the
declaration. 
SEC. 28. If the goods and chattels specified in the declaration,
sha~l ~ot. have been replevied an~ delivered to the plaintiff, such 
plaintiff, m case be shall recover Judgment upon the whole record,
shall be entitled, in addition to his judgment for damages and 
costs, to a further judgment, that such goods and chattels be re­
plevied and delivered to him without delay, or in default thereof,
that such plaintiff do recover from the defendant the value of such
goods and chattels, as the same shall have been assessed by the
jury on the trial or upon the writ of inquiry. 
SEC. 29. The execution to be issued upon such judgment, shall
command the sheriff to levy the plaintiff's damages and costs of
the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the defendant, as
in other executions against property, and also to replevy the goods
and chattels described in the declaration, which shall also be spe­
cified in the execution, and to deliver them to the plaintiff, if they
can be found within his county; ancl if the same cannot be so
found, then that he levy the value of such goods and chattels,
specifying the same, together with the aforesaid damages and costs
of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the defendant,
as above provided. 
SEc. 30. The sheriff shall proceed in the same manner to collect
any moneys directed to be collected upon such execution, as upon 
executions against property in personal actions; and he shall pos­
sess the same powers m respect to the replevying of the property
described therein, as are herein provided upon· the execution of
writs of replevin. If the goods and chattels described in the exe­
cution are replevied and <lelivered to the plaintiff, they shall be
irrenleviable by the defendant. 
SEc. 31. If the property specified in the writ has been delivered
h I · · tr d h d r ]  d b d  · 
to t e p aintitt, an t e erenr ant recover JU gment y iscontin-
uance or non-suit, such judgment shall be that the defendant have 
return of the goods ancl chattels replevied, unless he shall elect to
waive such return pursuant to any of the provisions hereinafter 
contained ; and also that he recover the damages sustained by him
by reason of the detention of such goods and chattels, which dam­ 
ages shall be assessed by a writ of inquiry. 
81:e. 32. Whenever a defendant shall obtain judgment by de-
fault or in any other manner, after having pleaded any matter
which, if admitted by the plaintiff, would be sufficient in law to
entitle such defendant to a return of the property rep levied, he
shall be entitled to the like judgment as provided in the last sec-
tion. 
SEC. 33. The defendant, whenever he shall be entitled to a re-
turn of the property rep levied, instead of taking judgment for such
return as above provided, may take judgment for the value of the
property replevied, in which case such value shall be assessed by
the jury on the trial, or by a writ of inquiry, as the case may re­ 
quire.
SEC. 34. In every action of replevin, if the jury shall find the 
property of part of the goods and chattels replevied to be in the
pl_aintitt; and the residue th~reof to be in. the defend~t, they shall? 
without reference to the estimated value m the replevin bond, find 
and certify in their verdict the value of the part belonging to the
plaintiff, and, also, the value of the part belonging to the defend- 
ant, as it was at the time it was replevied ; and in such case the
defendant shall have jud~ent for the value of his part of the pro-
perty as replevied, or Judgment of return of such part in the 
discretion of the court.
SEC. 35. Whenever upon the trial of any action of replevin it 
shall appear that one party has a lien or claun upon the property 
in question, or a part thereof, to a part of its value only, and that
the right of property in the same, subject to such lien or claim, 
shall be in the other party, in such case the verdict and judgment
shall be according to the rights of the parties, and it shall be dis-
cretionary with the court whether the judgment shall be for the re-
turn of the property or for damages. 
SEC. 36. Whenever in an action of replevin there shall be no
trial upon the issue, but it shall be suggested to the court that one 
party has a lien or claim upon the property in question, or a part
thereof, to a part of its value only' and that the right of property 
in the same, subject to such lien or claim, shall be in the other 
party,' the court shall have power to impannel and swear a jury,
and in such case the verdict and judgment shall be as provided m 
the next preceding section. 
SEC. 37. Whenever judgment shall be rendered against a plain- 
tiff in an action of replevin, it shall be rendered against him and
the securities in the bond given in his behalf in pursuance of the 
provisions of this chapter, if any such bond shall have been given,
and execution shall issue against all, with the like effect as if they
had been parties to the suit. 
SEC. 38. Whenever a writ of inquiry shall be issued, pursuant 
to any provision contained in this chapter, the party suing out such
writ shall give the adverse party, in case he shall have appeared 
in the cause in person, or by attorney, sufficient notice of the exe-
cution of such writ of inquiry. 
SEC. 39. If the property specified in the writ has not been re-
plevied and delivered to the plaintiff, and the defendant recover
Judgment, such judgment shall be for costs merely, including the 
fees of the sheritr and jury, upon a claim of property, if one was
interposed. · 
SEC. 40. Every judgment recovered in the action of replevin,
whether in favor of the plaintiff or defendant, for any damages or 
costs, or for any other sum of money, shall be docketed in the
same manner, and shall have the like effect, as a charge upon the
real estate and chattels real, of the party against whom it is recov­
ered, as judgments in personal actions. 
SEC. 41. Whenever judgment shall pass against the plaintiff' in
replevin, whether by default or otherwise, and a return of the pro­
perty replevied is awarded, no writ of second deliverance shall be
allowed, nor shall any second or other writ of replevin be brought
for the same cause ; but the plaintiff in replevin shall not thereby
be barred from bringing an action of trespass or trover for the same
property, unless the judgment in the action of replevin shall have
passed against him on the merits. 
SEC. 42. The writ of withemam, and all writs of second deliv­
erance, are hereby abolished. 
SEC. 43. Whenever an action of replevin shall be brought by or
against the sheriff of any county, the writ, and all process in the 
cause, shall be awarded to, and executed by, the coroner of the
county.

tor of some county within this state; and the service thereof shall
not be deemed complete, unless the party serving the same shall
tender to the person in whose custody the prisoner may be, if such
person be a sheriff, coroner, constable or marshal, the fees allowed
by law for bringing up such prisoner ; nor unless he shall also give 
bond to such sheriff, coroner, constable or marshal, as the case may 
be, in a penalty double the amount of the sum for which such pri-
eoner may be detained, if he be detained for any specific sum of
money, and if not, then in the penalty of one thousand dollars, condi-

person1 upon whom such writ shall be served, having the custody, 
of the mdividual for whose benefit the writ shall be issued, to obey
and execute such writ according to the command thereof, without
requiring any bond or the payment of any charges, unless the pay-
ment of such charges shall have been required by the officer issu- 
ing such wriL 
SEC. 4 7. Every officer allowing a writ of habeas corpus, directed 
to any other than a sheriff, coroner, constable or marshal, may, in 
his discretion, require as a duty to be performed, in order to render
the service thereof effectual, that the charges of bringing up such 
~ner shall be paid by the petitioner ; and in such case he shall,
m the allowance of the writ, specify the amount of such charges, so 
to be paid, which shall not exceed the fees allowed by law to sher-

writ of habeas corpus, treated of in this chapter, are hereby abro­
gated, except so much and such parts thereof as may be necessary

authority of courts and officers to award such writ, or to proceed

criminal case lawfully pending in the same court ; or to bring in
any prisoner to be examined as a witness, in any suit or proceed­
ing, civil or criminal, pending in such court, when they shall think
the personal attendance and examination of' the witness necessary
for the attainment of justice.

such officer or member of such body or board, which fine, when

ted or acknowledged a debt for a greater sum than I honestly or

sons so summonec! and appearing, shall be balloted for and drawn 
in like manner as jurors in a court of record, and shl11 be sworn
by such officer well and truly to hear, try and determine the vali- 
dity of the objections so specified.

any officer, having heard the proofs and allegations of the parties,
shall determine the matter submitted to them, and for that purpose, 
shall be kept together by some proper officer, to be sworn, as is
usual in like cases in courts of record, untill they agree upon their
verdict, and such verdict shall be conclusive in the premises, un-
less reversed on writ of error as hereinafter directed.

of any creditor, touching his estate or debts, or any matter stated
in his schedule, and may be required to state any change, which
may have occurred in the situation of his property, since the mak-
ing of his schedule, and particularly whether he has collected any
debts or demands, or made any transfer of any part of his real or

by competent proof, that such insolvent has co1lected any debts or
demands, or made any transfer, absolute or conditional, or other-

forthwith, to the officer or to the clerk of the court, before whom the
hearing shall be had, the full amount of all debts and demands so
by him collected or received, and the fu]l value of all property so
