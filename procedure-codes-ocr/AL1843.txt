ell, That where any such joint cause of action shall exist, it shall belr
lawful for the plaintiff in such suit or action, to sue out two or more
writs, directed to the sheriﬂ's or other proper ofﬁcers of the different
counties where such defendants or parties jointly chargeable may be
found, which process such sheriﬁ' or other ofﬁcer shall execute ac
cordingly, and return to the court from which the same issued, as in
other cases; and such writs, so issued and retumed, shall be ﬁled
together, and shall have the same force and effect, and the same pro
ceedings and recovery may be thereupon had, as if one single writ
had issued against all the defendants jointly ; but it shall be the duty
of the clerk or attorney issuing such process, to endorse thereon, that
both or all of the said writs are for one and the same cause of action,‘
or otherwise the same shall abate on the plea of the defendant.
§ 60. And whereas, it is a rule of common law, thatin case ofthe
death of a joint obligor, the debt can never survive against his heirs,
executors, or administrators, which rule is frequently injurious and
oppressive to the surviving obligors : to remedy which, Be it enatt-
ed, That, in case of the death of one or more joint obligor or obli-
gors, the joint debt or contract shall survive against the heirs, exec-
utors, and administrators of the deceased obligor or obligors, as well
as against the survivor or survivors : and when all the obligors shall
die, the debt or contract shall survive ainst the heirs, executors,
and administrators of all the said joint 0 ligors.

and it shall be lawful to sue out process and proceed to judgment

the defendants to any such joint judgment, it s all be lawful for the
plaintiff or his attorney, at any time after the return of said writ, or
an alias writ, to discontinue such action against any one or more of

been executed, and proceed to judgment against any one or more of
said defendants, on whom said writ shall have been executed, or
proceed to issue an alias or pluries writ, at his election.(1)
§ 2. Whenever any cause of action may exist against two or
. . .
more partners, of any denomination whatever, it shall be lawful to

i ' _
the same on any one of them, shall be deemed equivalent to a ser
vice on all ; and the plaintiff may ﬁle his declaration and proceed to
judgment as if the said writ had been served on each defendant; and
the judgment shall be equally valid and effectual against all the de
fendants.
§ 64. Where any suit shall be instituted against two or more per
sons as partners in any ﬁrm, if one or more persons, not partners in
said ﬁrm, shall have been sued as such, the court, before whom such
suit is pending, shall discontinue said suit against such person or
. . .
persons, as shall appear not to be partners in said firm, and proceed
to judgment and execution against all or any of the defendants in
such action who shall appear to be partners.

bond or note, and all the obligors or ayers thereto shall not be served

not so served, ten days before the trial term of said suit, that he or
they have been sued on such bond or note, and that he or they will,
at the time when said suit is tried, move the court where the same is
depending, for judgment against him or them. ‘And it shall be the
duty of said court, upon sufﬁcient proof, to give judgment according
to the right and justice of the case, and direct execution to issue,
for the obligee or payee, in such bond or note, or for the plain
tiff or plaintiffs" in the motion, as may best comport with the justice
of the case, and the rights of the parties, and with such endorsements
. . .
as may be necessary to effect the object ; and the executions, in both
cases, shall be put into the hands of the sheriff or other ofﬁcer at the
same time.
§ 66. In all cases of motions being made as aforesaid, the defend
ant therein may plead any plea, which may be necessary to try the
cause according to the right and justice thereof; and a jury shall be
empanneled to try the issue joined between the parties, as in other
cases.
§ 67. Where any person or persons shall have a cause of action
against any co-partnership, any of the membersof which may have
died, such person or persons shall be permitted to sue and recover
of the representatives of the deceased partner or partners, without
. . . .
ﬁrst havmg prosecuted the survnvmg partners to insolvency : Pro
viderl, The plaintiff shall, before instituting such suit, make aflidavit
in writing, before the clerk of the proper court, or court itself, to be
ﬁled with the papers, that the survivor is insolvent or unable to pay
the amount of the debt, or is beyond the. jurisdiction of the court: '
Provided, further, That when any such representative is sued sepa
rately, which may be done without such afﬁdavit, no execution shall
issue against such representative until an execution is bona ﬁllt run
and returned nulla borm as to the survivors.
§ 68. Where plaintiff shall bring suit as a ﬁrm or co-partnership,

without the intervention of a jury to inquire of the damages,
and award execution thereon, as in other cases. (1)
§ 71. Whenever the demurrer to the declaration, in an action of

an inquiry of damages directed by the court, it shall be lawful for
the inquiry thereof to be had at the same term at which such de-in
