§ 4. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the

§ 1. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof,
shall be deemed material, unless it have actually misled the adverse
party to~his prejudice in maintaining his action or defence upon the mer—
its. When it shall be alleged that a party has been so mis ed, that fact
shall be roved to the satisfaction of the court, by aHidavit shewing' in
what res ect he has been misled; and thereupon, the court may order
the plea ings to be amended, upon such terms as shall be just.

§ 2. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the facts to be found according to the evidence, or may order an immediate amendment without costs.

to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in some particular or
particulars only, but in its entire soope and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of variance within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.
In case of such failure of proof, and a verdict of the jury or finding of
the-court against the party so failing, and the court is satisiied from the
proof given that the party has a good cause of action or defence, as the'
case may be, and such party will apply for a new trial and undertake to
proceed without unnecessary delay, the court‘shall grant such new trial,
and permit the pleadings, if necessary, to be amended, on such‘terms as
may be just and reasonable. And in every case where there has been a
mistake or surprise of a party or his agent or attorney, or a misdirection
of the jury by the court, or a mistake by the jury, or a finding contrary
to the direction of the court‘ in any matter of law, or a fraud or deceit
practiced by one party on the other, or the court is satisfied that perjury
or mistake has been committed by a witness, and is also satisfied that an
impmper verdict or finding was occasioned by any of the matters afore~
said, and that the party has a just cause of action or defence, it shall
grant a new trial, and, if necessary, permit the pleadings to be amended, I
on such terms as may be just and reasonable. 

§ 4. Any pleading may be amended by the party of course, without
costs and without prejudice to the proceeding already had, at any time
before the answer to it shall be' filed.

§ 5. The court may, at any time, in furtherance of justice, and on
such terms as mayfbe proper,‘jamend any pleading or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in

 

the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect material to the
case, or by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved.

§ 6. The court may, in every stage of the action, disregard any error
or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which shall not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party; and nojudgment shall be reversed or
affected by reason of such error or defect.

§ 7. The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on
motion, to make a supplemental petition, answer or reply, alleging facts
material to the case, or praying for any other or different relief or order,
or judgment;

§ 8. When either party shall amend any pleading or proceeding, and
the court shall be satisfied, by affidavits or otherwise, that the opposite
party could not be ready for trial in consequence thereof, a continuance
may be granted to some day in the same term or to another term of the
court.
