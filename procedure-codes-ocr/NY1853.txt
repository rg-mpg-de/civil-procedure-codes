judgment in such action: ‘

3. When the arrest is on an execution or commitment to enforce
the payment of money, and the party arrested is not recaptured
or surrendered into custody, at the expiration of the time limited
for the service thereof, or legally discharged therefrom:

the sheriff. In an action by thesheriif against the prisoner or his
sureties, the judgment against the sheriff for the escape of the

service is to be made, or that he is a necessary or proper party to
an action, relating to real property in this state, such court or
judge may grant an order that the service be made, by the publication of a summons, in either of the following cases:

1. Where the defendant is a foreign corporation, and has property within this state or the cause of action arose therein.

‘ 2. Where the defendant.being a resident of this state,has departed therefrom, with intent to defraud his creditors, or avoid
the service of a summons, or keeps himself cencealed therein,
with the like intent, and the action arises on obligation:

3. Where he is nota resident of this state, but has property
therein, and the action arises on obligation, and the court has
jurisdiction of the subject of the action: _

4. Where the subject of the action is real or personal property

. in this state, and the defendant has, or claims, a lien or interest,

actual or contingent, therein, or the relief demanded consists,

wholly or partly, in excluding the defendant from any interest or
lien therein :

5. Where the action arises upon a mortgage on property in this

state, and the defendant is personally chargeable with the debt
for which the mortgage is security :6. Where the actionis for divorce, in the cases prescribed by
law. '

§ 623. The order must direct the publication to be made in two
newspapers to be designated, as most likely to give notice to the

person to be served, and for such length of time as may be deemed
reasonable, not less than once a week, for six weeks. In case of

publication, the court or judge must also direct a copy of the
summons and complaint to be forthwith deposited in the post

otlice, directed to the person to be served,at his place of residence
unless it appear that such residence is neither known to the party

, making the application, nor can with reasonable diligence be

ascertained by him. When publication is ordered, personal service of a copy of the summons and complaint out of the state is

equivalent to publication and deposite in the post office. In either

case the service of the summons is to be deemed co‘r.plete, at the
expiration of the time prescribed by the order for publication.

§ 624. If the summons be not personally served on a defendant,
nor received by him through the post office, in the cases provided
for in the last two sections, he or his representatives, on application and suilicient cause shown, at any time before judgment,
must be allowed to defend the action ; and, except in an action
for divorce, the defendant or his representatives may, in like manner, be allowed to defend after judgment, or at any time within
one year after notice thereof, and within seven years after its rendition, on such terms as may be just; and if the defence be successful, and the j udgment,or any part thereof,have been collectedor otherwise enforced, such restitution may thereupon be compelled as the court directs, but the title to property sold under

such judgment to a purchaser in good faith, shall not be thereby. .

affected.

§ 625. Where the action is against two or more defendants,and
the summons is served on one or more, but not on all of them, the
plaintiff may proceed as follows: _

1. If the action be against the defendants jointlyindebted upon
an obligation, he may proceed against the defendants served, unless the court otherwise direct, and if he recover judgment, it may be entered against all the defendants thus jointly indebted, so far
only as that it may be enforced against the joint property of all,

and the separate property of the defendants served, and, if they
are subject to arrest, against the persons: or, ‘

2. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he may
proceed against the defendants served, in the same manner as if ‘
they were the only defendants.

§ 626. Proof of the service of the summons, and of the complaint
or notice, if any, accompanying the same must be as follows:
1; If served by the sheriff, his certilicate thereof; or,
2. If by any other person, his ailidavit thereof; or,

3. In case of publication, the ailidavitof the printer,or his foreman, or principal clerk, showing the same ; and an aflidavit of a

deposit of a copy of the summons in the post office, if the same
shall have been deposited : or

4. The written admission of the defendant:

In case of service, otherwise than by pub1ication,the certificate,
ailidavitor admission must state the time and place of the service.

§ 627. From the time of the service-of the summons in a civil

action, or the al1owance_of a provisional remedy,. the court is
deemed to have acquired jurisdiction, and to have control of all

the subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appearance of a defendant is equivalent to personal service of the summons upon
him.

language, without unnecessary repetition, any new matter, not inconsistent with the complaint, constituting a defence to the counter claim.

CHAPTER VI.

GENERAL RULES OF PLICADING.

§ 645. Every pleading must be subscribed by the party, or his
attorney, and the complaint, answer and I‘( ply, must be veriiied
by the affidavit of a party, his agent or attorney,to the effect that

hcbelieves it to be true. When the aflidavit is made byithe.

agent or attorney, it must set forth the reason of his making it.

The verification may be omitted, when an admission of the
truth of the complaint might subject the party to prosecution for
felony. And no pleading, verified as herein required, can be used

in a criminal prosecution against the party, as proof of a fact
admitted or alleged in such pleading.

§ 646. It is not necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading
the items of an account therein alleged, where they exceed twenty
in number, but he must deliver to the adverse party, within ten
days, after a. demand thereof in writing, a copy of the account
verified by his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, to the
effect that he believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving
evidence thereof. The court, or a judge thereof, or a county

judge, may order a further account, when the one delivered is
defective.

§ 647. In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its eiiect, its allegations must be liberally construed,
with a view to substantial justice between the parties. ‘

§ 648. If irrelevant or redundant matter be inserterd in a

pleading, it may be stricken out by_ the court, on its own view of
it, or upon motion of any person aggrieved thereby. And when

the allegations of a pleading are so indeiinite or uncertain, that
the precise nature of the charge or defence is not apparent, the

court may require the pleading to be made definite -and certain,
by amendment.

§ 649. In an action for the recovery of real property, it .must
be described in the complaint with such convenient certainty, as
to enable an officer upon execution to identify it. _

§ 650. In pleading a judgment, or other determination, of‘ a
court or ofhcer of special jurisdiction, it is not necessary to state
the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly given or made. If
such allegation be controverted, the party pleading must establish
on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction. .

§ 651. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in
a contract, it is not necessary to state the facts, showing such performance; but it may be stated generally, that the party duly
performed all the conditions on his pa rt; and if such allegation
be controverted, the party pleading must establish on trial the
facts showing such performance. In an action or defence founded
upon an instrument for the unconditional payment of money

only it is sufficient for a party to give a copy of the instrument

and to state that there is due thereon, from the adverse party, a
specified sum which he claims, '

§ 652. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived there£rom,it is sufiicient to refer to such statute, by its title and the
day of its passage, and the court must thereupon takejudlcial
notice thereof. , ' '

§ 653. In an action for libel or slander, itis not necessary to
state in the complaint, any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of
showing the application to the plaintiff, of the defamatory matter

out of which the cause of action arose; but it is suihcient to state
generally, that the same was published or spoken concerning the

plaintiff, and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintiff must
establish, on the trial, that it was so published or spoken.

§ 654. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the defendant may in his answer, allege both -the truth of the matter charged
a defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce

the amount of damages; and whether he prove the justification
or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.

§ 655. In an action to recover the possession of property distrained for doing damage, an answer that the defendant, or person
by whose command he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real
property upon which the distress was made, and that the property distrained was at the time doing damage thereon, is sufhcient
without setting forth the title to such real property. . '

§ 656. The plaintiii‘ may unite in the same complaint several
causes of action, whether they be such as have heretofore been

denominated legal or equitable, or both, where they all arise

out of :
1. The same transaction or transactions connected with the

same subject of action.
2. Contract, express or implied: or,

3. Inj urles with or without force to person and property, or
either : —

4. Injuries to character: or,

6. Claims to recover specific real property, with or without
damages, forthe withholding thereof, and the rents and profits
of the same: or, ‘

6. Claims to recover specific personal property, with or without damages, for the withholding thereof : or,

7. Claims against a trustee, by virtue of a contract, or by operation of law : or,
But the causes of action, so united, must all belong to one of

these classes, and must affect all the parties tothe action, and not
require different places of trial, and must be separately stated.

§ 657. Every material allegation of the complaint not specifically controverted by the answer, as prescribed in section 638;
and every material allegation of new matter in the answer constituting a counter claim, not controverted by the reply, as prescribed in section 644, must for the purposes of the action,be

taken as true. But the allegation of new matter in the answer
not relating to a counter claim, or of new matter in a reply, is
to be deemed controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct
denial, or avoidance as the case may require.

§ 658. A material allegation in a pleading, is one essential to
the claim or defence, and which could not be stricken from the
pleading, without leaving it insullicient.

CHAPTER VI.

MISTAKE: IN puzanmcs, AND amaxnmnms.

§ 659. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and
the proof, is to be deemed material unless it have actually misled the adverse party, to his prejudice in maintaining his action
ordefence, upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged, that a
party has been so misled that fact must be proved to the satisfa.ction of the court and it must be shown in what respect he has

been misled; and thereupon the court may order the pleading

to be amended, upon such terms as may be just.

§ 660. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the
last section, the court may direct the fact to be found according
to the evidence, or may order an immediate amendment, without costs.

§ 161. Where, however, the allegation of the claim or defence to
which the proof is directed is unproved, not in some particular
or particulars only, but in its entire scope and meaning, it is not
to be deemed a case of variance, within the last two sections,
but a failure of proof-.

§ 662. Any pleading may be once amended by the party of
course, without costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings already had, at any time before the period for answering it

expires, or, if it do not delay the trial, it can be so amended at
any time within twenty days after service of the answer to such
pleading. In such case a copy of the amended pleading must be
served on the adverse party. After the decision of a demurrer,
either at a general or special term, the court may, in its discretion, if it appear that the demurrer was interposed in good
faith, allow the defendant to answer, upon such terms as to trial
by the court of referees, or as to costs, or otherwise, as may be
just. If the demurrer be allowed for the cause mentioned in the
5th subdivision of 633, the court may, in its descretion, and upon
such terms as may be just, order the action to be divided into
as many actions as may be necessary to the proper determination of causes of action therein mentioned.

§ 663. The court may, at any time, before or after judgment,
in furtherance of justice, and on such _terms as may be proper,
amend any pleading or proceeding, by adding or striking out
the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of
a party or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other
allegations material to the case, or, when the amendment does
not change substantially the claim or defence, by conforming
the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, allow an answer or reply to be made,
after the time limited by this act, or by an order enlarging such
time, and may also, at any time within one year after notice
thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order, or other proceeding, taken against him through his mistake, inadvertance,
surprise, or excusable neglect; and may supply anomission, in
any proceeding. And whenever any proceeding taken by a party
faik to conform in any respect to the provisions of this code, the
court may permit an amendment of such proceedings, so as to
make it conformable thereto.

§ 664. When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proeeeding, by any name; and when his true name is discovered,

the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly.
§ 665. The court must, in every stage of an action, disregard

any error, or defect in the pleadings or proceedings, which
does at axect the substantial rights of the adverse party; and

no judgment can bereversed or affected by reason of such error
or defect.

§ 666. The plaintiff and defendant respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint, answer or

reply, alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the former complaint, answer or reply. '

may be corrected by the jury" under the advice of the court, or
the jury may be again sentout.

general verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact, to be

stated in writing, and may direct a written finding thereon. The
special verdict or finding must be tied with the clerk and entered upon the minutes.

of the court, assess the amount of the recovery when the court
gives judgment for the plaintitf on the answer.

if the property have not been delivered to the plaintiff, or the defendant by his answer claim a return thereof, the jury must, if
their verdict be in favor of the plaintiif, or if being in favor of
the defendant, they also iind that he is entitled to a retnrn_thereof, must assess the value of the property, and may at the same
time assess the damages, if any are claimed in the complaint or

‘ answer, which the prevailing party has sustained by reason of the

taking or detention of such property.

§ 788. Upon receiving'a verdict, an entry must be made, in the
minutes of the court, specifying the time and place of the trial,
the names of the jurors and witnesses, the verdict, and either the
judgment to be rendered thereon, or where the court is in doubt

§ 820. There are three kinds of writs of execution; one against ‘

the property of the judgment debtor; another against his person;
and the third for the delivery of the possession of real or personal
property, or such delivery with damages for withholding the
lame. They are issued in the name of the people and are deemed

the process of the court,but they need not be sealed nor subscribed,
except as prescribed in the next section. b J

§ 821. The writ of execution must be directed to the sheriif,
subscribed by the party issuing it, or his attorney, and must
intelligibly refer to the judgment, stating the court, the county
where the judgment roll or transcript is filed, the names of the
parties, the amount of the judgment, if it be for money, the
amount actually due thereon, and the time of docketing in the
county to which the execution is issued, and must require the

° sheriff substantially as follows :° _

1. If it be against the property of the judgment debtor, it must
require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of
the personal property of such debtor, and if sufficient personal
property cannot be found out of his real property, or if the
judgment be a lien on real property, then out of the real property
belonging to him on- the day when the judgment was docketed
in the county, or at any time thereafter, or if the judgment be

entered pursuant to the iirst subdivision of section 625, the execution must conform to such judgment :

2. If it be against real or personal property, in the hands of
personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants of real
property, or trustees, it must require the sheriff to satisfy the
judgment, with interest, out of such property:

3. If it be against the person of the judgment debtor, it must

‘require the sheriff to arrest such debtor, and commit him to the

[jail of the_ county, until he pay the judgment, with interest, or

be discharged according to law : ,

4. If it be for the delivery of the possession of real or personal
property, it must require the sheriii‘ to deliver the possession of
the same, particularly describing it to the party entitled thereto,
and may at the same time require the sheriff to satisfy any costs

charges, damages, rents or profits recovered by the same judg-ment, out of the personal proper-ty.of the party against Whom it

,was rendered, and'the value of the property for which the judgJnent was recovered to be specified therein, if a delivery thereof

cannot be had, and if suilicient personal property cannot be found,

then out of real property, as provided in the first subdivision of
this section, and in that respect it is to be deemed an execution

against property.

§ 822. The execution must be made returnable within sixty
days after its receipt by the sheriif,‘ to the clerk with whom the
judgment roll is filed. '

§ 823. When a judgment requires the payment of money or the
delivery .of real or personal property, the same is enforced in
those respects by execution, as provided in the last three sections.
Where it requires the performance of any other act, a certified
copy of the judgment may be served upon the party against
whom it is given, or upon the person or /officer who is required
thereby, or by ‘law, to obey the same, and his obedience thereto
enforced. If he refuse, he may be punished by the court, as for
a contempt. ‘

§ 821. After the lapse of five years from the entry of judgment,
if no execution have been already issued, an execution can be issued only by leave of the court on motion, upon notice to the adVerse party. Such leave must not be given unless it be established by the oath of the party, or other proof, that the judgment,
or some part thereof’, remains unsatisfied and due.

W'hen the judgment has been rendered in a justice’s court, and
docketed in the otiice of the clerk of p the county, the application
for leave to issue execution must be to the county court of the
county where the judgment was rendered, or in the city and
county of New.Yorlt, to the court of common pleas of that city,
and such court has jurisdiction over the judgment and execution.

§ 825. Notwithstanding the death of a party after judgment,

where the judgment is docketed. Where it requires the delivery
of 1.93] or personal property, it must be issued to the sheriff of
the county where the property, or some part thereof, is situated.
Executions may be issued, at thesame time, to different counties.
§ 327. If the action be one in which the defendant might have
been arrested, as provided in the first three subdivisions of section 668, an execution against the person of the judgment debtor

may be issued to any county within the jurisdiction of the court,
after the return of an execution against his property, unsatisfied
in whole or in part. An execution against the person may likewise be issued, after such return, in the cases mentioned in the
fourth and iifth subdivisions of that section, where the defendant
has been provisionally arrested in the action, and the order for
his arrest has not been vacated, or upon an order of arrest obtained in the same manner as for a provisional arrest.
§ 828. A person arrested on execution must be imprisoned

within the jail, or the liberties thereof, and there kept at his own
expense, until satisfaction of the execution, or his legal discharge.

§ 829. When a defendant has been once imprisoned upon execution, no other execution can issue upon the same judgment,
unless he escape or die, while charged in execution, or unless he
be discharged without the consent of the judgment creditor.

§ 830. All property liable to an attachment is liable to execution.‘ It must be levied ,on, in the same manner as similar
property is attached, pursuant to section 722. Until a levy,
property is not affected by the execution, but when there are
several executionsiii the hands of the same sheriff or his deputies, the proceeds of the sale must be applied in the order of the
delivery of the executions to the sheriff or- deputies. '

§ 831. If the property levied on be claimed by a third person
as his property, the sheriff may summon from his county any
twelve persons, qualified as jurors between the parties, to try the
validity of the claim. They and the witnesses must be sworn
by the sheriif and if their verdict be in favor of the claimant,
he sheriff may after reasonable notice, relinquish the levy, unless
thej udgment creditor after reasonable notice, give him a suflicient
indemnity for proceeding thereon. The fees of the jury must be
paid by the claimant, it’ the verdict be against him, otherwise by
the plaintiff.

§ 832. The following property owned by a householder, and in
actual use, or kept,for use by and for his family, or when being

years, an action may be brought by one or more of such persons,

persons interested therein, and for a sale of such property, or a
part of it,-if it appear that a partition cannot be made, without

great prejudice to the owners.

§ 912. The summons must be addressed by name to all the
joint tenants, and tenants in common, who are known, and
generally to all persons unknown, having or claiming an interest
in the property.
§ 913. The interests of all persons in the property, whether
such persons be known or unknown, must be set forth in the

complaint specifically and particularly, as far as known to the .

plaintitf, and if any one or more of the parties, or the share or

quantity of interest of any of the parties, be unknown to the
plaintiif, or be uncertain or contingent, or the ownership of the
inheritance depend upon executory devise, or the remainder be a

-contingent remainder, so that such parties cannot be named, that
fact must be set forth in the complaint. ‘

§ 914. The plaintiff may, at his option, make creditors, having
.a specific or general lien upon the property, or upon any particular portion thereof, parties to the action.

§ 915. When the lien is on an undivided interest or estate of
-any of the parties, such lien, if a partition be made, is thenceforth a charge only on the share assigned to such party; but
‘such share must be tirst charged with its just proportion of the

costs of the partition, in preference to such lien.
§ 9l6. If a party havinga share or interest be unknown, or

either of the known parties reside out of the State or cannot be
found therein, and such fact be made to appear by atlidavit, the
-summons may be served on such absent or unknown party, by

publication, directed by the court or judge, in the manner prescribed by sections 622 and 623. When publication is made, the

summons, as published, must be accompanied by a brief description of the property, which is the subject of the action. °

§ 917. The rights of the several parties, plaintiH's as well as
defendants, may be put in issue, tried and determined by such

action; and where a defendant fails to answer, or where a sale of

the premises is necessary, the ‘title'must be ascertained by proof

to the satisfaction of the court, before the judgment for partition
or sale is given. s
§ 918. If it be alleged in the complaint, and established by

evidence, to the satisfaction of the court, that the property or any
partof it, is so situated that partition cannot be made, without

great prejudice to the owners, the court may order a sale thereof,
and for that purpose may appoint one.or more referees. Otherwise, upon the requisite proofs being made, it must order a partition, according to the respective rights of the parties, as ascertained by the court, and appoint three referees therefor; and

must designate the portion to remain undivided, for the owners,
whose interests remain unknown or not ascertained.

§ 919. In making the partition, referees must divide the property, and allot the several portions thereof to the respective
parties, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to
the respective rights of the parties, as determined by the court,
designating the several portions by proper landmarks, and may
employ a surveyor, with the necessary assistants, to aid them
therein. .
§ 920. The referees must make report of their proceedings,‘
specifying therein the manner of executing their trust, describing
the property divided, and the shares allotted to each party, with
a particular description of each share. '
§ 921. The court may confirm or set aside the report, and if
necessary, appoint new referees. Upon the report being condrmed, judgment must be rendered, that such partition be eti‘ectnal forever, which judgment is binding and conclusive:

1 . On all the parties named therein, and their legal represent-W
atives, who have at the time any interest in the property divided,
as owners in fee, or as tenants for years, or as entitled to the reversion, remainder or inheritance of such property, after the
termination of a particular estate therein: or who, by any contingency, may be entitled to a beneiicial interest in the property,
or who have an interest in an individual share thereof,as tenants

for years, for life, by the curtesy, or in dower :

2. On all persons interested in the property, who may be unknown, to whom notice shall have been given of the application

for partition by the publication directed by section 916 : and

3. On all other persons claiming from such parties or persons,
or either of them.

§ 922. But such judgment and partition cannot affect tenants,
or persons having claims as tenants, in dower, by the curtesy or
for life, to the whole of the property, which is the subject of the
partition; nor can such judgment and partition preclude any
person, except such as are specified in the last section, from claiming title to the property ‘in question, or from controverting the title of the parties between whom the partition is made.

§ 923. The expenses of the referees, including those of a surveyor and his assistants,when employed, must be ascertained and
allowed by the court ; and. the amount thereof, together with the
fees allowed by law to the referees, must be paid by the plaintiff,
and may be allowed as part of the charges.

§ 924. If the referees report to the court, that the property, of
which partition shall have been directed, or any distinct portion
thereof, is so situated, that a partition thereof cannot be made,
without great prejudice to the owners; and the court is satislied
that such report is correct, it may thereupon, by an order, direct

the referees to sell the property or portion so situated.

§ 925. When a part of the property only is ordered to be sold,
if there be an estate by the curtesy,iu dower, or for life, or years,
in an undivided share of the property, the whole of such estate
may be set oil‘ in any part of the property not ordered to be sold.

§ 926. Before the making of an order for sale, where the
-creditors having specific liens have not been made parties, the
court on the motion of either party must direct the plaintitf to
amend his complaint, if necessary, by making every person having a specific lien on the undivided interest or estate of any of ,
the parties by mortgage, devise or otherwise, a party to the action.

§ 927. The plaintiff must produce to the court the certificate

of the clerk of the county where the property is situated, showing

‘whether there are any general. liens by judgment upon the property, or any part thereof.
§ 928. Unless it be made to appear to the court, by the certificate of the clerk, pursuant to the last section, that there are outstanding no general liens on the property, or on any share or parcel thereof, the conrt must order a reference to ascertain them.

§ 929. If it appear by the certificate that there are outstanding
of record such general liens, the court must appoint a referee to
ascertain whether such liens have been paid,or if not paid, what
amount remains due or secured by them respectively, and the
order of priority in which they are entitled to be paid out of the
property.

§ 930. The plaintiff must cause a notice to be served, at least ten
days before the time for appearance, on each person having such

general lien, to appear before the referee at a specified time and
place, to make proof by his own aflidavit or otherwise, of the

true amount due, or to become due, contingently or absolutely, on
his judgment. ' T

§ 931. The referee must receive the evidence, and report the
namesof the creditors whose liens are established, the amounts
thereof, and their priority respectively, and if such liens are contingent he must specify them. He must attach to his report the
proof of service of the notices, and the afiidavits and copies of
other evidence before him. '

§ 932. Any creditor having a lien, and being dissatisfied with
the report of the referee, may move the court to correct it, at any

time before distribution of the proceeds of sale, on ten days’ notice to the plaintiff and the other persons in whose favorliens are

reported, and thereupon the court may correct the report on the
evidence reported, or if necessary, may order a new reference of
the whole or of any part of the matter. When confirmed, the report is conclusive of the rights of the several creditors on whom
notice was served.
§ 933. The proceeds of the sale of the incumbered property,
must be applied under the direction of the court, as follows :
1. To pay its just proportion of the general costs of the action :
2. To pay the costs of the reference: ' '
3. To satisfy and cancel of record the several liens in their
order of priority, by payment of the sums‘ due and to become due,
the amount remaining due to be verified by aiiidavit at the time.
of payment: A
4. The residue, among the owners of the property__g_old, according to their respective shares therein. -. ,
§ 934. The proceedings to ascertain the amount of incumbrances, and to determine their priority as above provided, or
those herein authorized to determine the rights of parties, to funds
paid into court, must not delay the sale, nor affect ‘any other
party, whose rights are not involved in such proceedings. 0
§ 935. The proceeds of sale, and the securities taken by the
referees, or any part thereof, may be distributed by them to the
persons entitled thereto, whenever the. court so directs. But in
case no direction be given, all such proceeds and securities must

be paid into court, or deposited as required by law’, or directed by
the court.'

§ 936. When the proceeds of sales of any shares or parcels, belonging to persons, who have become parties to the action, and

who are known, are paid into court, the action may be continued
as between such parties, for the determination of their respective
claims thereto, which must be ascertained and adjudged by the
court. Further testimony may be taken, in court, or by a referee, at the discretion of the court, and the court may, if necessary, require such parties to present the facts or law in controversy, by pleadings, as in an original action. .

§ 937. All sales of real property, made by referees under this chapter, must be made by public auction to the highest bidder,
upon notice, published in the manner required for the sale of real

property on execution. The notice‘ must state the terms of sale,

prior estate, charge or specitic lien, that must be stated in the notice.

§ 938. The court must, in the order for sale, direct the terms
of credit Which may be allowed, for the purchase money, of any
portion of the premises of which it may direct a sale on credit,
and for that portion of which the purchase money is required, by

the provisions herein after contained, to be invested for the benefit
of unknown owners, infants, parties out’ of the state, or tenants in

§ 940. When the estate of a tenant in dower, or by the curtesy,
or for life or years, in the whole or any part of the property in
question, has been admitted by the parties, or ascertained by the
court, to be existing at the time of the orderfor sale, and the person entitled to such estate, has been made a party to the action,
such estate may‘be first set off out of any part of the property,
and a sale made of such parcel, subject to ‘the prior unsold estate
of such tenant therein. But if in the judgment of the court, a
due regard to the interests all the parties, require that such estate
be also sold, the sale may be so ordered‘.

§ 941. If a sale of the property, including such estate, be ordered, the estate and interest of every such tenant or person passes

§ 943. If such consent be not given, at or before the report of sale,
the court must ascertain and determlne what proportion of the
proceeds of the sale, after deducting expenses, will be a just and

§ 975. When a judgment has been rendered in such action,
whether brought by the attorney general, or by a stockholder or

main: ‘or nnvrsus.

§ 980. A cause of action arising out of an injury to the person,
dies, with the person of either party, except as provided in section 928.

§ 981. All other causes of action, by one against another,
whether arising on contract or not, survive to the personal representatives of the former and against the personal representatives of the latter. Therefore the executors or administrators

may maintain the action against the party, against whom the cause
of action accrued, or after his death against his representatives.
§ 982. When the death of one is caused by the wrongful act or

omission of another, the personal representatives of the former
may maintain an action therefor against the latter, if the former
might have maintained an action, had he lived, against the latter,

for an injury caused by the same act or omission. But the action .

must be commenced within two years after the act or omission
by which the death was caused; the damages thereon cannot exceed tive thousand dollars; and the amount recovered is to be for
the exclusive benefit of the widow and next of kin, to be distributed to them in the same proportions as the personal property
of a deceased person. \

§ 983. In action against several executors or administrators,
they are all considered as one person representing their testator
or intestate, and judgment may be taken, and execution issued
against all who are named as defendants in the summons, although it be servcclonly on part of them, in the same manner as '

if served on all, except as provided in the next section.
§ 981. When a judgment is taken againstgan administrator or
executor upon failure to answer, it is not to be deemed evidence

of assets in his hands, unless it appear that the complaint alleged
assets, and was personally served on him.

§ 985. The time which shall have elapsed between the death
of a person, and the granting of letters testamentary or of administration on his estate, not exceeding six months, and the period
of six-months after the granting of such letters, are not to be

deemed any-part of the time limited for the commencement of
actions by executors or administrators.

§ 986. An executor of an executor has no authority as such to
commence or maintain an action or proceeding relating to the

property of the testator of the first executor, or to take any
charge or control thereof. '

§ 987. The real property, which belonged to a deceased person,
is not bound, or in any wayaffected, by a judgment against his
executors or administrators, nor liable to be sold, by virtue of an
execution issued upon such judgment.

§ 988. In an action against executors or administrators, in
which the fact of their having administered the estate of their
testator or intestate, or any part thereof, comes in issue, and the
inventory of the property of the deceased, filed by them is given
in evidence, the same may be repelled by evidence:

1. That any property has been omitted in such inventory, or
was not returned therein at its full value: ’

2. That such property has perished or been lost, without the
fault of such executors or administrators; or that it has been
fairly sold by them at private or public sale, at a less price than
the value so returned; or that, since the return of the inventory,
such property has deteriorated or increased in value. In such
action, the defendants cannot be charged for any things in action,
specified in their inventory, unless it appear that they have been
wllected, or might with due diligence, have been collected.

§ 989. No person is liable to an action as executor of his own
wrong, for having taken, received, or interfered with, the property
of a deceased person; but is responsible to the executors, or general or special administrators, of such deceased person, for the
value of all property so taken or received, and for all damages,
caused by his acts, to the estate of the deceased. ‘.

§ 990. The next of kin of a deceased person are liable to
action by a creditor of the estate, to recover the distributive
shares, received out of such estate, or so much thereof, as may be

necessary to satisfy his debt. The action may be against all the‘

next of kin jointly, or against any one or more of them severally.

§ 991. In such action, the plaintiff may recover the value of
all the assets received by all the defendants in the action, if necessary to satisfy his demand; and the amount of the recovery
must be apportioned among the defendants, in proportion to the
value of the assets received by each; and no allowance or deduction can be made from such amount, on account of their being
other relatives to whom assets have also been delivered.

§ 992. Any one of the next of kin, against whom a recovery
is had pursuant to the last action, may maintain an action against

All the other relatives of the testator, to whom any such assets
have been paid, jointly, or against any of them separately, for a
just and equal contribution, and may recover of each defendant
such an amount as shall be in the same proportion to the whole
sum collected of the plaintiff, as the value of the assets delivered
to such defendant bore to the value of all the assets delivered to
all the relatives of the deceased. ‘

§ 993. Legatees are liable to an action by a creditor of the /

testator to recover the value of any legacy received by them.
The action may be brought against all or only one of the legatees.
In such action the plaintiff cannot recover unless he shows:

1. That no assets were delivered by the executor or administrator of the deceased,ito his next of kin : or

2. That the value of such assets has been recovered by some
other creditor: or

3. That such assets are not suiiicient to satisfy the demand of
the plaintiff: .
L And in the last case, he can recover only the deficiency. The
whole amount which the plaintiif can recover, must be apportioned among all the legatees of the testator, in proportion to the
amounts of their legacies respectively, and his proportion can
only be recovered of each legatee. 

§ 994. If an action be brought against several next of kin of
jointly, or against ‘several legatees jointly, for assets delivered
to them, and a recovery be had against them‘, the costs of such
action must be apportioned among the several defendants, in proportion to the amount of the debt or damages recovered against
each of them.

§ 995. In case of a judgment against several next of kin of a
testator, or against several legatees, the payment or satisfaction
of the amount recovered against any one of the defendants, discharges such defendant, and exonerates him and his property from
the judgm.ent- ” '

§ 996. Heirs .and devisees are liable to an action by a creditor
of a deceased person, to recover the debt, to the extent of the
value of any real property inherited by, or devised to, them. If

Such action be against the heirs, all the heirs who may be liable
rnnst be made parties to the action.

§ 997. But the heirs are not liable for the debt, unless it
appear that the personal assets of the deceased were not suflicient
to discharge it, or‘ that after due proceedings before the proper

. surrcgate’s court, the creditor has been unable to collect the debt

from the personal representatives of the deceased, or from his
nex_t of kin or legatees. If the personal assets were sutlicient to

pay a part of the debt, or in case a part, thereof shall have been
collected, as mentioned, in the last section, the heirs of such

deceased person are liable for the residue.

§ 998. But the last section does not affect the liability of heirs
for a debt of their ancestor, where such debt was, by his will‘
expressly charged exclusively on the real property descended to
such heirs, or where such debt is by the will expressly directed
to be paid out of the real property descended, before resorting to
the personal property. 

§ 999. In cases where the next of kin, legatees, heirs and
devisees are liable for the debts of their ancestors, as herein provided, they must give preference in the payment of the same,
and are liable therefor, in the following order:

1. Debts entitled to a preference under the laws of the United
States:

2. Judgments against the ancestor or testator, according to the
priority thereof respectively:

3. Recognizances, bonds, sealed instruments, notes, bills and
unliquidated demands and accounts. '

§ 1000. No preference can be given by any next of kin, legatee,
heir or devisee, to one debt over another of the same blass, except
one specified in the second subdivision of the last section; nor is
a debt, due and payable, entitled to a preference over a debt not
due; nor does the commencement of an action against any next
of kin, legatee, heir or devisee, for the recovery of a debt, entitle
it to a preference over others of the samevclass.

§ 1001. The next of kin, tlcgatees, heirs and devisees, may
show that there are debts of a prior class unsatisfied; or that

there are unpaid debts of the same class with that on which the
action is brought; and if it appear, that the value of the personal

property delivered to them, or of the real estate descended or
devised to them, does not exceed the debts of a prior class,
judgment must be rendered in their favor. i

§ 1002. If the personal property delivered to such next of kin
or legatees, or if the real estate descended or devised to such
heirs and devisees, exceed the amount 'of debts which are entitled

to a preference over the debt for which the action is brought,
judgment must be rendered against them only for such a sum as

shall be a just proportion to the other debts, of the same class

with that on which the action is brought.

§ 1003. If a debt of a class prior to that on which the action
is brought, or of the same class, shall have been paid by any next
of kin, legatees, heirs or devisees, they may prove such payment,
and the amount of the debts so paid must be estimated in ascertaining the amount to be recovered, in the same manner as if

such debts were outstanding and unpaid, as prescribed in" the last
two sections. . .

§ 1004. If it appear that the real property so descended-, was
not aliened by the heir, at the time of the commencement of the

action, 'of if the heir confess the claim, and show what real property has descended to him, the court must order that the debt of

the plaintiff, or the proportion thereof which he is entitled to
recover, be levied of the real property so descended, and not

otherwise; and every judgment rendered in such action has preference, as alien on the real property descended, to any judgment obtained against such heir personally, for a debt or demand
in his own right.

§ 1005. When it appears, in the action, that before the mmmencement thereof, the heir has aliened the real property descended  him, or any part thereof, he shall be personally liable

for the value of the property so aliened, and judgment may be
rendered therefor and execution awarded, as in actions for his

own debts. But no real property aliened in good faith by an
heir, before action commenced against him, is liable to execution,
or in any manner affected by a judgment against him.

§ 1006. In actions brought against several heirs jointly, or

several devisees jointly, the amount, which the plaintiff recovers,
must be apportioned, among all the heirs of the ancestor, or among

all the devisees of the tcstator, in proportion to the value of the

real property descended or devised, and such proportion only can
be recovered of each heir or legatee.'

§ 1007. Devisees made liable, by the foregoing provisions of ,
this chapter, to the creditors of their testator, are not so liable,
unless it appear that his personal assets and the real property of
the testator descended to his heirs were insuflicient to discharge
the debt; orunless it appear, that after due proceedings before
the surrogate, the creditor has been unable to recover the debt,
or any part thereof, from the personal representatives of the
testator, or from his next of kin or legatees, or from his heirs.

§ 1008. In either of the cases specified in the last section, the
amount'of the deficiency of the personal assets, and of the real
property descended, to satisfy the debt of the plaintiff, and the

amount which such plaintiff may have failed to recover from the
personal representatives of the testatpr, his next of kin, legatees

and heirs, may be recovered of the devisees of such testator,_to'
the extent of the real property devised to them respectively.

§ 1009. But the last two sections do not affect the liability of
devisees, for a debt of their testator, where such debt was, by his
will, expressly charged exclusively upon the real property devised,
or by the terms of the will made payable exclusively by such ,devisee, or made payable out of the real property devised, before
resorting to the personal property or to any other real property
descended or devised. ‘ -'

§ 1010. The provisions of this chapter, with regard to heirs,

and to proceedings by and against them, and to judgments and
executions against them, are applicable to actions and proceedings

against devisees; and they must, in like manner, be sued jointly.

§ 1011. In cases where, by the provisions of any statute, a
child born after the making of a will, is entitled to succeed to a
portion of the testator’s real and personal property, such child
shall have the same rights and remedies to compel a distribution
of the personal property and a partition of the real property, as are
provided for next of kin and for heirs; and shall, in all respects,
be liable, in the same manner and to the same extent, to the
creditors of his ancestor, in respect to the personal property
delivered to him, and the real property descended to him, as are
herein prescribedin relation to next of kin and heirs; and such

child may recover of the legatees and devisees, who may have
received or taken any real or personal property of the testator,
the share or portion thereof to which he may be entitled.

§ 1012. The provisions of the last two sections relative to a
child, born after the making of a will, apply equally tmevery
person, who being a witness to a will, is entitled, by the provisions

of any statute, to recover a portion of the real or personal property of. the testator, from the legatees‘ and devisees named in such
will.

town, city, village or other municipal body, it is in like manner,
to be construed as security severally to all persons intended to be

seemed, as well. as to the body politic named therein.

§ 1014. When a public oiiicer, by official misconduct or neglect of duty, forfeits his official bond, or renders his sureties liable upon an official security, any person injured thereby, or who

action thereon, in his own name, against the officer and his sureties, to recover the amount to which he may be entitled, by reason oi the delinquency.

§ 1015. Before an action can be brought by a plaintiff, other
than the people, or body politic named in the security, leave must
be obtained of the court or a judge thereof, or a county judge,
within the district or county where the action is triable; and leave
can onlyqbe granted, on a production of the copy of the bond, and

such, as that if established on the trial, it would entitle the party applying to recover in the action, leave must be granted.

§ 1016. A judgment in favor of a party for one delinquency,
does not preclude the same, or another party, from an action on
the same security, for another delinquency.

§ 1017. If it appear in action against a surety, on an official security, that he has already been obliged, by reason of prior recoveries against him on the same, to pay amounts, which in the
aggregate, are equal to the extent of his undertaking, or
that, by reason of the insolvency of his principal, he will be
obliged to pay to that extent on judgments already recovered
against the surety, he shall be discharged. And the recovery
against a surety must, in allcases, be limited by the amount of
his undertaking.

§ 1018. Upon the execution issued on a judgment, recovered
upon the oihcial security of a public officer against him and a su- '
rety, there must be endorsed a direction to the oiiicer, to whom
the execution is delivered, to collect the same out of the property of the principal, if suiiicient can be found, and if not, then to
collect it out of the property of the surety. . ~

§ 1019. If there ,be several judgments on which executions’ are,
at the same time, in the sheriii"s hands, against a public oiiicer
and his sureties, amounting in the aggregate to a sum greater than

that, for which the 'sureties are liable, the court must, on their
application, limit the amount to be collected of them, to the

amount of their respective liabilities, and may cause the same to
be applied on the judgments or executions, in proportion to such

amounts.

§ 1020. Actions for lines and forfeitures, may be prosecuted’ by_ '

the omcers or persons, to whom they are by law given, br who,

by special provision of law, are authorised to recover them; and \
whether prosecuted by public officers, or by private persons, are .

governed by the same rules as other civi-I actions, except as- otherwise specified in this chapter. ’*

§ 1021. When an action is brought for a penalty, which is limited by law, not to exceed a certain amount, the action may 
brought for that amount; and upon the trial, the amount reovered, must be determined in proportion to the offence.

§ 1022. A recovery of a judgment, for a penalty or forfeiture:
by collusion between the parties, with intent to save the defendant from the consequences contemplated by law, in a case where.
the penalty or forfeiture is given, wholly or partly, to the prosecutor, does not prevent the recovery of the same by another per8011.
§ 1023. Fines and forfeitures, not specially granted or appropriated by law, must be paid into the treasury of the state ; and
whenever by the provisions of law, any property, real or personal, is forfeited to the people of this state,or to any officer for their

3. When it is objected at the trial, and appears by the evidence,
that the action is brought in the wrong county or town or by a .

plaintiff not a resident of the county, without giving security, as
provided in section 1073; but if the objection be taken and overruled, it is cause only of reversal on appeal, and does not otherwise invalidate the judgment, if not taken, at the trial, it is waived, i

and is no cause of reversal.
§ 1106. When the defendant fails to appear and answer, judgment must be given for the plaintiff, as follows:
1. Where a copy of the complaint and account, or instrument,
has been served personally with the summons, as prescribed in section 1060, judgment must be given without further evidence

for the sum specified in the summons:
2. In other cases the justice must hear the evidence of the

plaintiff, and render judgment for such sum only as shall appear
by the evidence to be just; but in no case to exceed the amount

§ 1107. Upon issue joined, if ajury trial he not demanded, the
justice must hear the evidence, and decide all questions of fact
and of law, and render judgment accordingly.

§ 1108. Upon a verdict, the justice must immediately render
judgment accordingly. When the trial is by the justice, judg-ment must be entered immediately after the close of the trial, if
the defendant has been arrested, or his property attached; in
other cases, it must entered either at the close of the trial, or, if
the justice then desire further time to consider, on the fourth day
thereafter, both days inclusive.

§ 1109. When the amount found due to either party exceeds
the sum, for which the justice is authorised to enter judgment,
such party may remit the excess, and judgment may be entered
for the residue.

§ 1110. In an action arising on contract, when there is no counter claim, if the plaintiff fail to recover judgment for an amount
equal to that stated in the summons, he cannot recover costs.

§ 1111. If the defendant, at any time before the trial, offer in

sum, the plaintih‘ may immediately have judgment therefor, with
the costs then accrued. But if he do not accept such offer before

the trial, and fail to recover in the action a sum equal to the oifer, ,

he cannot recover costs accrued after the offer ; but costs must be‘
adjudged against him, and if he recover, deducted from his recovery. But the oner, and failure to accept it, cannot be given

so stated in the judgment, and entered in his docket.

§ 1113. The justice, or clerk of the court, on the demand of a

the clerk of the county where the judgment was rendered. The
time of the receipt of the transcript by the county clerk, must
be noted by him thereon, and entered in the docket; and fnom
that time, the judgment creates a lien in the same manner as a
judgment of the supreme court. Upon the transcript of such

docket, certified by the clerk of the county, and tiled in any other
county, the judgment may be there docketed with the same effect,

from the time of filing and docketing in that county. The jnd_g- ,

ment so docketed, and the enforcement thereof, are subject to the
control of the county court of the county where it was first
docketed, as a judgment of that court. But a judgment for less
than twenty-five dollars, so docketed, is not a lien upon, and
cannot be enforced against real property.

§ 1114. Execution for the enforcement of a judgment in a justioe’s court, except when it has been docketed in the county
clerlr’s office, may be issued by the justice before whom the judgment was rendered, or by his successor in office, or the clerk of

1. It it be a case where the defendant cannot be arrested, it
must direct the oflicer to’ collect the amount of the judgment out

of the personal property of the debtor, and to pay the same to the
party entitled thereto:

2. If it be a case where the defendant may be arrested, in addition to the foregoing, it must direct the officer, if suflicient property of the defendant, liable to the execution, cannot be found
to satisfy the judgment, that he arrest the debtor, and commit him
to the jail of the county, until he pay the judgment, or be discharged according to law:

want of sutiicient personal chattels, if there be not sufiicient subject to levy, known to the officer, or if upon demand by the cmcer of the debtor, he fail to produce sufficient property, the officer

may without further delay arrest the defendant. When arrested,
the defendant must be conveyed to the common jail of the county,

and there be kept in custody until the execution with costs be
paid, or he be discharged by due course of law.

§ 1119. The debtor committed as provided in the last section,
may be held in prison ten. days; and if he be a person without a
family, for which he provides, one day in addition, for every dollar over ten due on the execution ; or, if he have a family for

twenty due on the execution.

oEce,' execution can only be issued by the clerk with whom the

transcript is filed, or by the plaintiff in person; and it may be
sent to one or more counties where the judgment is docketed. It
must conform substantially to the execution issued by a justice,

except that it must state the time when the judgment was docketed in the county from which it is issued, and must be directed
to the sheritf, and may direct, that for want of suiiicient personal
property the debt may bejmade out of the real property of -the
debtor. ‘

from a judgment entered upon the report of referees or’ the direction of a single judge of the same court, in all cases, and upon ’

the fact when the trial is by the court or referees. Such an appeal,
however, does not stay proceedings, unless security be given as
upon an appeal to the court of appeals, or unless the court or a
judge thereof so order, which ‘order may be made upon ‘such

terms as to security or otherwise, as may be just, such security
not to exceed the amount ‘required on an appeal to the court of

- provisional remedy : .

2. When it grants or refuses a new trial; or when it sustains
or overrules a demurrer: ' l

3. When it involves the merits of the action, or some part
thereof; or affects a substantial right: i

4. When the order in effect determines the action and prevents
a judgment from which an appeal may be taken: ‘

5. When the order is made, upon a summary appllcation in an
action after judgment, and a&‘ects a substantial right.

§ 1181. The last section includes an order made out of court
upon notice; but in such case, the order must be first entered
with the clerk. And for the purpose of an appeal, any party
affected by such order, may require it to be entered with the
clerk, and it must be entered accordingly.

CHAPTER II.

THE WRIT OF REVIEW OF INFERIOR JURISDICTION. «

§ 1261. The writ of certiorari, whether at common law or by
statute, shall hereafter be known as the writ of review of inferior
jurisdictions.

§ 1262. The writ of review must command the defendant to
certify fully to the supreme court, at a specified time and place,
and annex to the writ, a transcript of the record and proceedings
(describing or referring to them, with convenient certainty), that
the same may be reviewed by the supreme court; and requiring
the party, in the mean time, to desist from further proceedings
in the matter to be reviewed.

§ 1263. If a stay of proceedings be: not intended, the words
requiring the stay, may be omitted from the writ. These ‘words
may be inserted, or omitted, in the sound discretion of the court.

§ 1264. The eifect of the writ is to remove, not the record, but
the transcript thereof; therefore, the power of the inferior court
or oiiicer is not suspended-, nor the proceedings stayed, unless an
order to that effect be inserted in the writ. . 

§ 1265. The writ may be granted, wherever specially authorized by this code, and also in all cases where an inferior tribunal,
board, or officer, exercising judicial functions, is alleged to have
exceeded the jurisdiction of such tribunal, board, or officer; and

where there is no appeal, nor, in the judgment of the court, any
other plain, speedy and adequate remedy. '

§ 1266. Except where otherwise expressly provided by this
code or another statute, the review upon this writ cannot be extended further, than to determine whether the inferior tribunal, ~

board, or oiiicer, has regularly pursued the authority of such
tribunal, board or ofiicer.

§ 1267. The writ may be directed to such tribunal, board, or
officer, or to any other person having the custody of the record
or proceedings to be certified. .

§ 1268. The motion for the writ must be’ made upon afiidavit,
and the court may require a notice of the application to be given
to the adverse party, or may grant an order to shew cause why

it should not be allowed, or may grant the writ without notice.
§ 1269. The allowance of the writ must be endorsed thereon,

signed by the judge granting it, and the writ must be served in '

the same manner, as a summons in a civil action, except where
otherwise expressly provided.

§ 1270. If the return to the writ be defective, the court may

order a further return to be made. When a full return has been
made, the court must proceed to hear the parties, or such of them
as may attend for that purpose, and may thereupon give judgment, either aiiirming or annulling the proceedings below. 

§ 1271. A copy of the judgment, signed by the ‘clerk, entered
upon, or attached to, the writ and return, constitute the judgment
roll. From the judgment, an appeal may be taken to the general
term, and thence to the court of appeals, in the same manner
and upon the same terms, as from a judgment in a civil. action.

CHAPTER 111. ‘

-nu‘. wax-r or mmnsrn.
§ 1272. The writ, -heretofore known as .the writ of mandamus,

-" shall be hereafter denominated the writ of mandate. Such writ .

is defined and regulated as in this chapter prescribed.
§ 1273. It may be issued to any inferior tribunal, corporation,
board, or -person, to compel the performance of an act, which

’ the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an oiiice, trust,

‘or station. But though it- may require an inferior tribunal to
exercise its judgment, or proceed to the discharge of any of its
functions, it cannot control judicial discretion.

§ 1274. This writ ‘ought not to be issued, in any case where

there is a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, in the ordinary
course of the law. It is issued, on the information of the party
beneficially interested. ‘
§ 1275. The writ is either alternative or peremptory. The
alternative writ. must state concisely the facts showing the obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and his omission. to
perform it, and command him, that immediately after the receipt

= of the writ, or at some other specified time, he do the act required

to be performed, or show cause before the supreme court, at a
specified time and place, why he has not done so; and thathe
then and there return the writ, with his certihcate of having

done as he is commanded. The peremptory writ must be in a
similar form, except that the words requiring the defendant to

show cause why he has not done as commanded, mustbe omitted.

§ 1276. When the right to require the performance of the .act
is clear, and it is. apparent that no valid excuse can be given
for not performing it, a peremptory mandate may be allowed in
the first instance. In all other cases, the alternative writ must
be first issued.

§ 1277. The motion for the writ,the allowance, and the service
thereof, and the enforcement of obedience thereto, must be in the

same manner, as in case of the writ of review. ‘
§ 1278. On the return day of the alternative writ, or such

further day as the court may allow, the party, on whom the writ

shall have been served, may show cause, by answer made, in the
same manner as an answer to a complaint in a civil action.

§ 1279. If no hnswer be made, a peremptory mandate must be '

allowed against the defendant. If an answerbemade, containing
new matter, the same shall not in any respect conclude the plaintiff, who may on the trial or other proceedings avail himself of
any valid ohijection to its sufficiency, or may countervail it'by
proof, either in direct denial or by way of avoidance. .
§ 1280. No other pleading, ‘or written allegation, is allowed
than the writ and answer. These‘ are the pleadings in the case,

.and have the same effect, and are to be construed and may be

amended, in the same manner, as pleadings ina civil action, and
the issues thereby joined must be tried, and the further‘prooeedings thereon had in the same’ manner, as in a civil action. ’
§ 1281. Issues joined in the case, must be tried in the county
where the material facts set forth in the mandate are alleged to_

have occurred.

§ 1282. If judgment be given for the plaintiff, he shall recover
the damages which he shall have sustained, to be ascertained by
the court or a jury, or by referees," as in a civil action, together
with costs and charges; and a peremptory mandate must also
be awarded without delay.
§ 1283. A recovery of damages by virtue of this chapter,
against a party, who shall have made a return to a writ of mandate, is a bar to any other action against the same party, for the
making of such return.
§ 1284. Whenever a peremptory mandate is directed to a public oiiicer, body, or board, commanding the performance of any
public duty, specially enjoined by law, if it appear to the court
that such otiicer, or" any member of such body, or board, has,
without just excuse, refused or neglected to perform the duty so
enjoined, the court may impose a line, not exceeding two hundred
and hfty dollars, upon every such omcer or member of such
body or board. Such fine, when collected, must be paid into the
treasury; and the payment thereof is a bar to an action, for any,
penalty incurred by such oflicer or member of such body or board,
by reason of his refusal or neglect to perform the u y so enjoined.

CHAPTER IV.

law to take possession of real property, within this state, for the
use of the people of the state, and he cannot agree with the owner
for the purchase thereof, he mustcause application to be made
for a writ of assessment, which shall thereupon be issued to the
sheriff of the county, where such real property is situated, unless
the court direct such damages to be assessed by a jury of another
pounty, commandinghim to summon a jury to inquire whether
the owners of the property, describing it, will sustain any, and
what damage, by the taking of the property for the use of the
state. .

give at least three weeks notice of the time and place of executing the same by publishing a notice thereof in a newspaper printed in his county. - 

§ 1288. The sheriti‘ must summon twelve qualiiied jurors in his
county, to attend at such time and place, and must then and‘
there administer to each of the jurors an oath, that he will diligently inquire, concerning the matter‘ specified in the writ, and
will give a true verdict, according to the best of his judgment.

§ 1289. After the jury shall have been duly sworn, they must
proceed to view the property specified in the writ, and having
heard the evidence oHered, and duly considered the value of the
property, they must assess the damages which the owner, or if
there be several, which the respective owners, will sustain by
being deprived thereof. They must make an inquisition signed
by themselves, and by the sheriff, in which they must set forth
the names of the several owners of the property, and the rights
of each owner respectively, so far as the same can be ascertained
by them, together with the amount to be paid therefor by the
people of this state, and to whom particularly; which inquisition

the sherirmust forthwith return, together with the writ, to the
supreme court. '
§ 1290. The court must examine the inquisition, and if the

same be partial or defective, may set the same aside, either wholly
or in part, and may direct a new inquisition to be taken, to supply such defect.

§ 1291. Whenever the writ appears to have been duly executed, an order must be entered, declaring that the people of this
state, on paying to the owner or into the supreme court, the
amount assessed in the inquisition for damages, and also the costs
and charges of the proceedings, shall be entitled to an absolute
estate in such real’ property, as fully and effectually, as if the

same had been conveyed to the people by the owner thereof; and
immediately after the payment of such amount, the absolute title
to such real property shall be invested in the people of this state.
§ 1292. The amount which may be neceesary to pay the damages assessed, and the costs and expenses incurred under the provisions of this chapter, must be paid out of the treasury. '

§ 1293. Upon the damages so assessed being paid into the supreme court, the court must make an order for the investment
thereof and of the interest thereon, in permanent securities, for
the benefit of the owners of the property taken, and must cause

such securities to be transferred to them, or the amount of the
money paid over to them, their guardians or legal representatives,

whenever their rights are established.

§ 1294. Such owners may, at any time, apply to the supreme
court, for the payment to them of such money, or the transfer of
such securities: and such proceedings must be had thereon, as
are necessary to ascertain the respective rights of the applicants,
and to give" notice to all persons who may be interested in the
property taken, or in the money paid into court.

§ 1295. Whenever any real property shall be taken for the use
of the United States, by the consent of the legislature of this state,
and it becomes necessary to issue a writ of assessment, the like
proceedings must be had, as are provided in this chapter.

TITLE III.

OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF LIENS.

CHAPTER 1.

LIENS IN GENERAL .

§ 1406. A lien is a right to have satisfaction of a‘ claim out of
aparticular thing, or to retain possession of it until the claim is

§ 1407. The liens, of which the enforcement is provided in this title, are of four kinds:
1. Liens on buildings:
2. Liens on vessels:
3, Liens on cargoes for Wharfage:

4. Liens on things doing damage upon real property.

CHAPTER II.

LIENS ON BUILDINGS.

§ 1408. A person who, under the authority of the owner, performs labor or supplies .naterials towards the erection, alteration
or repair of a building, in a city or incorporated village of this

state, may create a lien on the building and on the interest of the

owner in the lot of land upon which it stands, for the price or
value of such labor or materials, as provided in this chapter. ‘

§ 1409. The aggregate of such lieps cannotexceed the amount
which the owner of the building would be otherwise liable to pay
for such erection, alteration or repair.

§ 1410. The lien must be registered with the clerk of the county
where the building is situated, or in the city of New-York, with
the register of that city and county, as follows:

The claimant must deliver to the clerk a ‘statement in writing,

verified by afiidavit, setting forth briefly the following particul8l'8 3 0 '

1. The situation of the building, designating it by the street on
which it is situated and the number of the lot, it‘ the street he
named,and the lot numbered, or otherwise by some certain or
known designation : ’

2. The owner of the building, under whose authority the lien
was created:

3. The particulars of the claim and the amount thereof, which
amount, if the claim be nlade before the labor has been performed or the materials supplied , and the amount payable therefor has
become due, must ‘be the amount payable by the terms of the
contract with the claimant, or capable of being ascertained therefrom by computation, if afterwards, the amount actually due:
and, ' "

4. A copy of the contract with the claimant, if it be in writing,

and if not in writing, a statement. of its substance.

§ 1411. The clerk must thereupon register the lien in a book
to be kept by him for that purpose, called the “book of liens,”

The entries must be arranged alphabetically under the name of

the owner and of the street, separately. It must contain the
name of the claimant and of the person against whom the claim

exists, the amount of the lien, the time when filed, and a brief
description of the property. A/copy of the statement must be
served on the owner by delivering it to him personally, or by

leaving it at his residence with a person of suitable age and dis- ‘

cretion, or by depositing it in the post oflice directed to him at his

place of residence. From the time of filing the statement and ser-_

vingthe copy,the claimant shall have a lien on the land and building
for the amount then actually due to him for work and materials,
or which afterwards becomes due, pursuant to the contract referred to in the statement ;‘ but such statement must be madeand
tiled before the expiration of thirty days after the completion of

the work or the supply of the materials.
§ 1412. The lien may be discharged as follows:

1. By filing a certificate of the claimant or his successor in interest, acknowledged or proved in the same manner as the satisfaction of a mortgage, stating that the lien is discharged : or.
2. By the deposit with the clerk, of a sum of money equal to

the amount claimed, which money shall thereupon be held subject to the lien: or _
3. Byan entry of the clerk, made in the book of liens, after

one year has elapsed since the filing of the claim, stating that no
notice has been given to him of legal steps to enforce the lien:

or
4'. By a notice from the owner to the claimant, after the amount

has become payable, requiring him to commence an action, for

i the enforcement of‘ his lien, and the lapse of thirty days thereafter,

without the commencement of such action: or 5. By satisfaction of the lien, upon an action for the enforcement thereof.

§ 1413. After the registry of a lien, and the performance of the
work, or the supply of the materials, the claimant or the owner

may either serve personally upon the other a notice in writing,
requiring him to appear before a justice of the peace of the county,

at a specified time, not less than five days from the time of service, and submit to an accounting for the amount due for such
labor or materials. At the time mentioned in the} notice, or at
such other time as the accounting may be adjourned to, the parties appearing must each deliver to the justice, an account in
writing of his claim or offset, if any, verified by affidavit, and

submit to examination thereupon, under the direction of the justice. If both parties appear, and there arise a question of fact,
a jury may he demanded by either, and such question must be
tried by a jury in the same manner, as an issue joined in an ordinary action in a. justice’s court. In like manner, a co/ntractor,
that is, a person who contracts with the owner for labor and ma- terials, and who employs persons under him to do work, or furnish materials, may serve on such persons, and receive from them
a similar notice with the like effect; and a payment made by the
owner, to a person employed by a contractor must be allowed by
such contractor, in his account with the owner, to the extent of
any judgment which may be recovered by such person against
such contractor, pursuant to this section. ,

§ 1414. Upon the accounting mentioned in the last section,
whether a jury be called or -not, witnesses may be produced by
either party, and judgment must be rendered upon the amount
found by the jury or the justice; which judgment has the same

effect, is subject to appeal, and may be enforced in the same
manner, as a judgment in an ordinary action in a justice’s court.

§ 1415. After the performance of the work, or the supply of
the materials, and the expiration of any credit stipulated for the
payment, the lien mentioned in this chapter may be enforced, by
an action. In such action, all persons whose liens are registered,
as provided in section 1410, may be made parties, and the court
may, by the judgment, direct a sale of the land and building for
the satisfaction of the liens and costs; such sale‘ to be without
prejudice to the rights of any prior incumbrancer, owner or other
persons not parties to the action. In such action a notice thereo
must be tiled in the same manner as in an action for the partition
or foreclosure of a mortgage of lands. If several such actions be
brought by diderent claimants, and be pending at the same time,
the court may order them to be consolidated into one.

CHAPTER III.

LIEN8 ON VESSELS.

§ 1416. A debt, amounting to at least’ fifty dollars, contracted
in this state by the owner, master, agent or consignee of a vessel,
is a lien upon the vessel, her tackle, apparel and furniture, when
contracted for either of the following purposes:

1. Work done, or materials furnished in this state, towards the
building, repairing, equipping and furnishing thereof :

2. Provisions and stores furnished in this state, proper for the
use of the vessel at the time they were furnished: . '

3. Wharfage and keeping the vessel in ‘ port, including the expense of employingjpersons to watch her.

This lien has preference over every other lien, except for marinc;-s’ wages. But it ceases in twelve days after the vessel leaves

the port where the debt was contracted for another place in this ’

state, and immediately upon her leaving this state.

4. Damage, occasioned to a vessel by collision with another,
through the negligence or willful misconduct of its navigator, if
it exceed iifty dollars, is also for thirty days after the collision, a,

lien upon the vessel doing the injury.
§ 1417. The lien mentioned in the last section, may be enforced

by an. action; in which the court may order the sale of the vessel.
and the tackle, apparel and furniture thereof, or the tackle, apparel and furhiture alone, and the application of the proceeds for
the purpose of satisfying the liens thereon. Upon a judgment
of sale, the sale must be made by the sheriif, and his bill of sale,
made in pursuance thereof, vests in the purchaser a "valid title to
the property sold, as against all the parties to the action.

§ 1418. Every person having an interest in or lien upon the
vessel whose name is known to the plaintiff, must be made by
name, a party to the action, either as plaintiff or defezrdant, and
all other persons having such interest or lien, are to be deemed
parties defendants.

§ 1419. The summons must be directedby name to the known
defendants, and generally to all other persons unknown having
an interest in the vessel or a lien thereon, and must contain a
brief description of the vessel, stating, if contained in the complaint, its name, the port to which it belongs, the name of its last
commander, and briefly the object of the action. The summons
must be served upon the defendants named therein as prescribed

in section 621, and upon the unknown defendants as prescribed in sections 622 and 623

§ 4120. In such action, the plaintiif, at the time of filing the,

complaint, mayhave the vessel attached as a security for the
satisfaction of such liens as shall thereon be adjudged valid. The
mode of proceeding to obtain such attachment, to execute and
discharge it, is the same as upon, the ordinary provisional remedy
by attachment. ,

§ 1421. If several such actions be brought by different persons
having liens upon the same vessel, and be pending at the same
time, the court may order them to be consolidated into one. .

§ 1422. No proceeding under this chapter can be had against a
vessel which shall have been seized by virtue of process from
a court of the United States, having admiralty jurisdiction, while
such vessel is actually held under such seizure, nor against a
vessel which shall have been sold by order of such court, except
for debts contracted after the sale. But nothing in this section

impairs the validity of any lien created by this chapter, the payment of which shall be decreed by a court of the United States.

CHAPTER IV.

LIEN8 ON CARCOES F OR '\VHARFAGE.

§ 1423. When a vessel has lain twenty-four hours at a wharf in
. this State, for which wharfage is due, and the same has been demanded of the master or owner, by notice ‘left on board with one
of the company of the vessel, and neither payment is made nor
security given therefor, the owner of the wharf may distrain any
chattels on board the vessel for the amount; and so, from time to
time as often as twenty-four hour’s wharfage becomes due. The
distress must be made by a constable or marshal.
§ 1424. The officer making the distress, must immediately give
notice thereof, with the cause of the’ distress, the amount of
wharfage due, and an inventory of the property taken, by leaving
it on board with one of the company of the vessel.
§ 1425. If, at the expiration of five days after the notice, the
wharfage due, with the costs of the distress, be not paid, and the
property distrained be not legally reclaimed, the officer must
summon two disinterested householders, who shall be sworn by

him, fairly to appraisethe property distrained. They must thereupon make and certify the appraisement.

§ 1426. The officer must, thereupon, give six days public notice
of the sale of the property distrained, by affixing it on a conspicuous part of the wharf for which the wharfage was due, and
also in two public places in the town or ward. On the day and
at the place appointed, he _must sell the property by public auction, and apply the proceeds to the satisfaction of the wharfage
due,.and costs, and pay the surplus, if any, to the owner of the

property.

custody of a party by his own act, without legal process, for the

enforcement of a lien.

property safely until the appraisement of his damage, and, within
twenty-four hours after the distress, unless it was made on a Saturday, and then before the Tuesday morning thereafter, he must
apply to two fence viewers of the town to make the appraisement.

§ 1430. The fence viewers must immediately repair to the place,
view the damage, and thereupon ascertain and certify the amount
thereof, with their fees. They must also determine any dispute
which may arise, respecting the sufficiency of a fence around the
property where the damage was done, and may take the testimony
of witnesses, and for that purpose may administer oaths.

§ 1431. When the distress is of beasts, and the damage and fees
are not paid, the distrainer, within twenty-four hours after the

appraisement, must cause the beasts distrained to be put into the '

the beasts so delivered, and unless the same be reclaimed or discharged according to law within six days, sell them, or so many
of them as may be necessary, by auction, giving forty-eight hours
notice thereof, by advertisement posted at the pound and at the

nearest public-place. While the beasts remain in the pound their
owner may feed them without disturbance. From the proceeds

of the sale the pound master, after deducting the amount of his
fees and charges for keeping the beasts, and the charges of sale,
must pay to the distrainer the damages so certified, with the fees of
the fence viewers, and the surplus, if any, to the owner of the

the appraisers, exceed fifty dollars,‘ the distrainer must also publish a similar notice, in the nearest newspaper, once a week for

four weeks; but in such case the time of sale must be at least ,

thirty days from the first publication of the notice. _

§ 1437. If the owner of the property be known to the distrainer, or if any person be known to him as claiming an interest
therein, and such owner or person be found or reside within the

county, the distrainer must also serve a copy of the notice, at

least six days before the sale, either personally on such owner or

actions, and out of the proceeds of the sale, after deducting his
own fees, pay to the distraiher the amount of damages certified,
the expense of the notice and all other expense that may have
been reasonably incurred in the safe keeping and preservation of

the property, to be ascertained and certilied by the county judge
or by a justice of the peace of the county, and the balance, if

any, pay to the owner of the property ; or if he be unknown, to

the county treasurer, for the owner, to be paid to him upon the
order of the county court, upon making application and proof of

sureties, to be approved by the court, to the effect that he will
pay the amount established to any person who, in an action on
such undertaking, commenced within two years from its date,
shall establish his right to such balance, or any part thereof; and
any person claiming such balance, or any part thereof, may prosecute the undertaking. '

or imprisonment, or both. But when the contempt, is not one of
those mentioned in the first or second subdivisions of the last section, or in the first subdivision of section 216, it must appear
that the right or remedy of a party to an action, or special proceeding, was defeated or prejudiced thereby, before the contemptcan be punished by imprisonment, or by,a fine not exceeding

without such previous arrest or answer, or upon such notice or
order to show cause.

§ 1148. If the party charged be in the custody of an ofiicer, '

by virtue of a legal order or process, civil or criminal, except
upon a sentence for felony, an order may be made for the production of such person, by the officer having_ him in custody,
that he may answer, and he shall thereupon be produced and
held, until an order be made for his disposal.

§ 1149. Whenever a warrant of arrest is issued, pursuant to’
this chapter, the court or oiiicer must direct, whether the person
charged may be let to bail for his appearance upon the warrant,
or detained in custody without bail, and if he may be bailed, the
amount in which he may be let to bail; The directions, given in

court or ofiicer thereupon, or pay, as may be directed, the sum

specified in the warrant.
§ 1452. The othcer must return the warrant of arrest, and the

undertaking, if any, received by him from the person arrested,by
the return day specified therein. If he fail to make the return, a

warrant of arrest not bailable may be issued _against him specify'ing therein the cause of issuing it.

§ 1453. The otiicer to whom the warrant mentioned in the last section is delivered, must execute it, by arresting the person proceeded against, bringing him personally before the court or ofIicer, and. detaining him in-custody until otherwise ordered.

§ 1454. When the person arrested has been brought up, or appeared, the court or ofiicer must proceed to investigate thecharge
by examining him and witnesses for or against him, for which an
adjournment may be had from time to time, if necessary.

§ 1456. Upon the evidence so taken, the court or oiiicer must
determine, whether the person proceeded against is guilty of the
contempt charged, and if it be adjudged that he is guilty of the
contempt, a fine must be imposed upon him, not exceeding two
hundred and fifty dollars, or he must be imprisoned not exceeding six months, or both. But in the discretion of the court or ofticer (in case of inability to pay the tine, or endure the imprisonment), he may be relieved in such manner and upon such terms
as may be just.

§ 1456. If an actual loss or injury, to a party in action or special proceeding prejudicial to his rights therein,have been caused
by the contempt, the court or oflicer, in addition to the fine or
imprisonment imposed for the contempt, may order the person
proceeded against to pay to the party aggrieved a sum of money

suiiieient to indemnify him, and to satisfy his costs and expenses,
which order, and the acceptance of the money under it, is a bar to

an action by the aggrieved party for such loss‘ or injury.

§ 1457. When the contempt consists in the omission to perform
an act which is yet in the powerof the person to perform, he may

be imprisoned, until he shall have performed it, and in that case
the act must be specified in the warrant of commitment.
§ 1458. Persons proceeded against, according to thetprovisions

of this chapter, are also liable to indictment for the same misconduct, if it be an indictable offence, but the court before which a

conviction is had on the indictment, in passing sentence, must
take into consideration the punishment before inflicted.


§ 1459. When the warrant of arrest has been returned served,

if the person arrested do not appear on the return day, the court
or officer may issue another warrant of arrest, or may order the

undertaking to be prosecuted, or both.‘ If the undertaking be

prosecuted, the measure of damages in the action, is the extent of

the loss or injury sustained by the aggrieved party, by reason of
the misconduct for which the warrantwas issued, and the costs of
the proceedings.

§ 1460. Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter, an ofiicer
is required to keep a person arrested in actual custody, and to

, bring him before a court or otlicer, the inability, from illness or

otherwise, of the person to attend is a sufficient excuse for not
bringing him up. Nor can the oihcer be required to confine a
person arrested upon the warrant in a prison, or otherwise to restrain him of personal liberty, except so far as may be necessary
to secure his personal attendance.

TITLE V.

ASSESSMENTS.

CHAPTER I.

ASSESSMENTS. FOR LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS.

§ 1461. Assessments, whether for benefit or damage, authorised
by any statute of this state, must, in the first instance,be made by

three commissioners appointed by the county court of the county,
in the following cases : ‘

1. When specific property, real or personal, is taken from the
owner and appropriated to public pm-poses other than for a plank
road or railway: ‘ '

2, When a con‘tribution_in,- money is required, towards the expense of local improvement, in opening streetsor. public roads:

§ 1462. The appointment of commissioners must be made upon
a previous notice from the party, in whose name the application

is made; and none but freeholders of the county can be appointed.

§ 1463. The notice must be given by advertisement, published

in a newspaper of the county, not less than once a week for three
weeks. n

§ 1464. From the time of their appointment, the commissioners,
and all their proceedings, shall be under the control of the court,
which may, in its discretion, direct the time and place of meeting
of the commissioners, and the time of making their report. The
court also has control over all the proceedings subsequent to the
report of the commissioners including the sale for the assessment,
if a sale be made. ‘ '

§ 1465. Any person, interested in the assessment, may make
himself a party to the proceedings, by giving to the commissioners written notice of his wish to be made a party, stating his name

and address; and thereafter is entitled to have at least six days
notice of the meeting of the commissioners, of the time of presenting their report, and of the sale, if any. The notice must be
served by delivering it to him personally, or sending the same

through the post office to his address; except that when a party
comes in after notice already given to the existing parties, a new

notice to him is not necessary. But the failure to give the notice ’

required by this section, does not aifect the jurisdiction of the
court. ’

§ 1466. The report of the commissioners may refer to a map

- annexed, accurately tracing the boundaries of property taken or

assessed, and need not otherwise describe such property in detail.
On receiving the report, the court may connrm or modify it,‘ or
may reject it, and order a new report to be made by the same or
other commissioners. _ ’ ’:

§ 1467. Any person interested, may present in writing objections to the'report, thefacts stated in such objections being veriiied by oath. The court must decide upon the objections, but if
it appear to the court, that there is a fact in dispute between the

y. parties, whether such fact be the amount of damages or other- ‘

wise, and a trial thereof by jury be demanded by either party,
such trial must be ordered.

§ 1468. When there is a trial by jury, the court may exercise
the same control over the jury and the verdict, that is exercised
in civil actions, and may thereupon make a iinal order in the
case.

§ 1469. Any sale or lease made for the purpose of satisfying the
‘assessments, mentioned in ‘the third subdivision of section 1461,

must be made within three years after the confirmation of the report of the commissioners. Such sale must be reported to the
court, which may confirm it, or for good cause order a resale,

but no sale can in any case be made, or lease granted, for a longer period than twelve years.

§ 1470. The commissioners are entitled for their services, to

the same fees as referees, but such fees, in the aggregate, can
never exceed one hundred dollars to each commissioner. Necessary surveyor’s fees, not exceeding two hundred dollars, and
clerk’s fees, for copies of papers, at the rate of live cents for every
hundred words, and printers fees at the rate allowed by law may
also be included in the assessment. No other fees, cos_ts or expenses of any kind, for any local improvement, or upon any assessment, or for proceedings in relation thereto, can be made a charge
upon the property. If the assessment be not paid, the expense
of enforcing the collection, to be fixed by the court may then be
added, not exceeding besides printer’s fees, one per cent on the

amount of the assessment.

CHAPTER II.

§ 1471. Any person desiring a private road to be opened over

the land of another, may make application therefor to the county
court of the county.

§ 1472. Such application must state brieiiy the circumstances
which make the road desirable to the applicant, and must be
verified by him. It must state the names and places of residence

of the owners and occupants of the land upon which the road is

proposed, and must beaccompanied by a map or plan of the road
proposed, and of the adjacent lands. ,

§ 1473. Upon receiving the application, the court mustmake
an order that the persons interested show cause, if they have any,
at a speciiied time and place, why the road should not be opened,
and in such order must direct the manner of serving the notice,
as may appear most likely to reach the persons interested, such

service to be not less than ten days before the time specified.

§ 1474. Upon proof of service of the order, if no sumcient
cause to the contrary -be shown, the court may make an order,
directing the sheriff to summon a jury of freeholders, to appear
at a speciiied ‘ time and place, to determine the necessity of the
road, and the amount of all damages —to be sustained by the opening thereof. A

§ 1475. The sheriff must execute the order by drawing from
the undrawn jury box of a’ justice in the town where the property
lies, and summoning eighteen jurors, not interested in the question, and indiiferent between the parties, to appear at the time
and place specified in the order; and upon the appearance of the
jurors, twelve of them must be drawn, and sworn to make a true
Inquisition in the premises. ‘

§ 1476. The jury must thereupon go upon the land proposed
to be, laid out for a road, and the adjacent land, and after exami- ’
ning the application, maps, and plans, and hearing such evidence
as may be offered, must make their inquisition and return the
same to the court. .

§ 1477. If the jury determine, that the road is necessary, it
must determine the proper width and location thereof, and the
amount of all damage to be sustained by the opening and continued use thereof. The court may thereupon make an order,

respect to which it -was applied for. A copy of the order must
be filed with the records of roads, in the city or town, where the
property is situated.

§ 1478. The court must fix the expense of the proceeding, at
such sum as may seem to it reasonable, not exceeding in the

whole one hundred dollars, and must direct the payment by the
applicant of the same, together with the damages found by the
jury, before procet ding to open the road.

§ 1479. The provisions of the. statutes, regulating the proceedings of commissioners, or other persons, appointed to estimate orassess the expense of local improvements, in the several cities and
villages of this state, or relating to such assessments, or to the
sale or lease of real property, for the failure to pay assessments,

so far as the same are consistent with the provisions of this chapter, remain in force; the term “‘commissioners,” being taken
to include all persons appointed to estimate or assess such damages.

to a judge of the court either in or out of court.

§ 1484. If the judge be satisfied, that the application and schedule are in conformity with this chapter, and if there appear

sufficient ground forthe application, but not otherwise, he ‘must
order notice to be given to all the stockholders, creditors and

others interested, to show cause, if they have any, at a speeitied
time and place, why the corporation should not be dissolved. He

may also, if the nature of the case require it, restrain, by injunction, the sale or transfer of any property, or the transaction of any

business, by or on behalf of such corporation, until the further
order of the court, and may also, then, or afterwards, appoint a

receiver, if, in his opinion, it be necessary.

§ 1485. A copy of the order must be served personally. on all
the members of the corporation residing and to be found, in the
same county, at least ten days before the time appointed, in the
same manner as a summons in an action. It must be served on

order of dissolution may be made, and a receiver appointed. Such

corporation shall thereby cease to exist, and its property shall be

will permit, after giving due notice thereof, make a second, and,

if possible, final payment to the creditors, and distribution of the
residue to stockholders, or others entitled, of the remaining assets

in his hands. If after the second distribution, there still remain
any part of the estate not collected or distributed, a third dis-_
tribution must be made in like manner, and so on, as often as may,
be necessary: but no distribution among the stockholders can be‘
made within one year afterthe appointment of the receiver, nor.
until after all the known debts are paid and liabilities discharged,
or a sufficient fund set apart for that purpose.

other claims of the same class at all former dividends, and‘ may
‘thereafter receive with others his just proportion.
§ 1494. Immediately after all the funds in the‘hands ofthe
receiver have been paid out and applied, he must make a report
to the court, containing a full and accurate account of his proceedings; which report must be tiled with the clerk of the court
in the county where the principal place of business of the corporation was situated. '

account, must be published once a week for three weeks, in a
newspaper printed in the county, and also in the state paper, and
-a copy of such notice must also be served on every party who has

‘the time of filing the same, and if no objection_ be made to it by
the service of notice, in writing, on the receiver, within that time,
that an order closing the account and discharging the receiver,
will be entered.
§ 1496. Upon satisfactory proof, produced to the court,showing
that such account has been filed after due notice thereof, in the
manner for the time prescribed in the last section, and that no
-objection has been made, thereto,by notice served on the receiver,

and distribution of the balance, if any be- found in the receiver’:

hands. Such onder ishnal as to all parties-receiving notice, pursuant to the provisions of this title.

according to the evidence.

jury, nor advise them in respect to their decision, except on questions of law.

person and his family, the surrogate may, upon a proper accounting by the committee of the personal and of the income of the
real property, order the real property, or such part thereof as he
may deem necessary, to be sold or mortgaged to procure the necessary funds therefor.

is likely to be permanent, the surrogate must, before ordering a

mortgages may be ordered, from time to time, as may be necessary.

placed in the hands of the committee.

§ 1562. The committee may be required to give new or additional security, or to render an account, and may be removed.
He is also subject, in all other respects, to the control and direction of the surrogate, in the same manner as the general guardian
of an infant.

§ 1563. The committee has power, under the direction of a
court of competent jurisdiction, to execute a conveyance of real

property, or to do any other act in the specified performance of a
contract made by the insane person or drunkard when he was
capable to contract. .

§ 1564. The power of a committee ceases, upon the death of the
insane person, and also when the disability in respect to which

he was appointed, has been adjudged by the surrogate to have
ceased, or when he has been removed for any cause as provided

in the next two sections.
§ 1565. Upon application to the surrogate to remove a committee or to revoke appointment, made upon the amdavits of at least
two respectable persons, showing misconduct of the committee, or
that the disability, in respect to which the committee was appointed, has ceased, a citation must be issued to the committee,

to the person upon whose application he was appointed, if living
within the county, and .to the next of kin, if any, within the
county, who are of full age, to show cause, if they have any, why
the appointment of the committee should not be removed or his

appointment revoked.

§ 1566. The citation mustjbe served at least fourteen days before the time appointed for the hearing. Upon its return duly
served, or upon another day to which the hearing may be adjourned, the surrogate must hear the evidence otfered for and
against the application. If sufiicient cause ‘for the continuance

of the committee be not shown, the surrogate must _by an orderdeclare, that the disability, in respect to which the committee

was appointed, has ceased, that the powers of the committee are
therefore revoked, and that the party for whom he was appointed

is restored to his original rights. If misconduct of the committee
be established, he must be removed and another appointed in his
place. _

§ 1567. The fees of the surrogate, on the appointment of a committee, are the same, as on the proof of a will, and for his removal, and the proceedings in relation thereto, the same as for similar services in case of administrators. Upon a trial before him,

the surrogate may order costs to be paid,eitl1er by a party, or out
