sw.o tla l answer must be given. 
28. Wben a contract is alleged in any pleading, a bare denial of
the COIW'l,Ct by the oppoeite party shall be construed only aa a denial 
of the making of the contract in fact., and not of it.a legality or ite
sufficiency in law, whether with reference to the Statute of Fraud& 
or otherwise, 
24. Wherever the oontA!nts of any document are material, it

fact., matter, or thing, it shall be sufflciAnt to allege such notice aa
a fact, unless the form or the precise terms of such notice be 
material.
27. Wherever any contract or any relation between any peraone 
does not arise from an exprees sgreemeut, but it is to be implied
from a series of letters or oonversationa, or otherwise from a number
of circumstances, it shall be sufficient to allege such contract or
relation as a fact, and to refer generally to such letters, conversa­
tious, or circumstances without setting them out in detail, And if 
in such case the person Ro pleadin~ desires to rely in the alterna­
tive upon more contracta or relations than oue as to be implied
from such circumstances, he may state the same in the alteruative. 
28. Neither party need in any pleading allege any matter of fact
which the law preeumes in his favour, or as to which the burden of
proof lies upon the otuer aide, unleaa the same bas first been
11peciftcally deuied.

Staleraettt of Claim. 
1. Claim.-W. H., of H., in the county of L., duly made bis last
will, dated the 19th day of March, 1861, whereby he appointed the
defendants the executors thereof, and bequeathed to them all hie
personal estate in t.rost, to call in, sell, and convert the same into
money, and tbereout to pay bis debts and funeral and testamentary
expenses, and to divide the ultimate surplus into three 11har('8 and
to pay one of such three shares to each of his two children, T. H.,
and E., the wife of E.W., and to stand possessed of the remaining 
third share upon trust for the children of the testator'& eon J. H.
in equal shares, to be divided among them when the youngest of
such children should attain the age of 21 years. And the teetator
devised bis real estates to the defendants upon trust until the
youngest child of tho said J. H. ebould attain the age of 21 years, 
to pay one third part of the rents thereof to the said T. H., and
one other third part thereof to the said E.W., and to accumulate
the remaining third part by way of compound interest, and so
soon as the youngest child of the said J. H. should attain the age 
of 21 years, to sell the said real estates, and out of the proceeds of
such sale to pay the sum of 10001. to the said T. H., ind to invest
one moiety of the residue in manner therein mentioned, and stand
poeaeesed thereof in trust kl pay the income thereof to the said E.,
the wife of the said E.W., during her life for her separate use, and
after her death for her children, the interests of such children
being contingent on their attaining the age of 21 years, and to 
divide the other moiety of such proceeds of sale and the accumu­
lauona of the third share of rents thereinbefore directed to be
accumulated among such of the children of the said J. H. a.a 
should be then living, and the iseue of such of them u should be
then dead, in equal shares per ~tirpes. 
2. The testator died on the 25th day of April, 1873, and bis said
will wae proved by the defendants in the month of Juno, 1878. 
8. The teetator died po88868ed of one third share in a leasehold
oolliery called the Paradise Colliery, and in tho engines, machinery,
atock in trade, book debts, and efreots belonging thereto. He wu
al8o entiUed to real estate, and other personal estate. 
"- The testator left T. H. and E., the wife of E.W., him sur­ 
viving. J. H. had died in the te8tator's lifetime, leaving four
children, and no more. The f.l&intUf, C./J., is the youngetit of the 
children of J. H., and attained the age of 21 year on the lit of 
June, 1871. Thit other three children of J. H. died without ls&ue
in the lifetime of the testator. 
6. E. W. has several children, but no child baa attained the ap 
of 21 iears. 
6. 'I. H. ia the testator's heir-at-law. 
7. The defeodanta bne not called in, sold, and converted into 
money the whole of the teetator's persona! est.a~ but ban 
allowed a considerable part thereof to remain outatanding; and in
particular the defeodani.e have not caHed iu, sold, or eonverted 
into mooey the testator'a interest in the said colliery, but have,
from the death of the testator to :tbe present time, continued to 
work the same in partnership with the other persona interested
therein. The estate of the t.e11tator bas sustained considerable lOM
by reason of such interest not having been called in, sold, or con­
verted into money. 
8. 'l'he defendants did not upon the death of the testator sell the 
teetator's furniture, plate, linen, and china, but allowed the tes­ 
tator's widow to poesess herself of a great part thereof, wiiliout
accounting for the same, and the same has thereby been lost to
the teetator's estate. 
D. The defendants have not invested the share of the testator's
residuary personal estate given by his will to the children of the
testator's eon J. H., and have not accumulated one third of the
reota and proflts of his real ff!tate as directed by the said will,
but. have mixed the same share and rents with their own moneys.,
and employed them io business on their own account. 
10. 1.'he defendants have sold part of the real estates of the tes­
tator, but a considerable part thereof remains unsold. 
11. A receiver ought to be appointed of tbe outstanding pel'80nal

Defendants. 
Statement of .Defence of the abo~-~ Ihfendanu.
1. De/~-Bhortly after the decease of the testator, the defend­ 
ant.,, &8 his executors, poeseesed themselves of and converted into
money the teetator" 1 personal estate, except bis share in the colliery 
mentioned in the plaintiffs' statement of claim. The moneys so
arising were applied in payment of part of the testator's debts and
funeral and testamentary expenses, but such moneys were not 
sufficient for the payment thereof in full.
2. The Paradise colliery was, at the testator's decease, worked 
by him in partnership with J. Y. and W. Y. and T. Y., both since
deceased, No written articles of partnership had been entered into,
and for many years the testator bad not. taken any part in the
management of the said colliery, but it was managed exclusively
by the other partners, and the defendants did not know with cer­
taint:y_to what share therein the testator was entitled. 
8. Upon the death of the testator, the defendants endeavoured to
ucertain the value of the testator's 1bare in the colliery, but the 
other partners refofled to give them any lnforrnadoL The de­ 
feod&ots thereupon h&d tLe books of the colliery enmined by a
competent accouutant, but they bad been so oareleuly kept thal
it was impossible to obtain from them any &ecurate informa\ion
respecting the state of the concern ; it wu, however, ucert&ined
that a considerable sum waa due to the testator's estate. 
4. Between the death of the testator and the beginning of the
year 1874 the defeudants made frequent applications to J. Y., W.Y.,
and 'I', Y. for a settlement of the accounts of the colliery. Such
appliclltions haviog proved fruitles,i, the defend&nle, in January, 
18i4, filed their bill of complaint in the Court of Chancery againat
J, Y., W. Y., and T.Y., praying for an account of the partnership 
dealings between the testator and the defendant.a thereto, and that
the partnership might be wound up uoder the direction of the 
Court.
5. The said T. Y. died in the year 1874, and the suit was revived 
against J .. P. and 1'. S., his executors. The suit is still pending.
6. AB to the Paradise colliery, the defendant.a have acted to the 
best of th,·ir judgment for the benefit of the test&tor's estate, and
they deny being under any liability in respect of the said r.olliery
not having been realised. TbPy sul,mit to act under the direction 
of tho court as to the further prosecution of the said suit and
generally as to the realisation of the testator's iotereel in the said 
colliery.
7. With respect to the statement.a in the eigh\b paragraph of the 
statement of claim. the defend&nt.a say, that upon the aeat.b of the
teatator, they sold the whole of his furuiture, linen, and china, and 
also all bis plate, except a few silver teaspoons of very small value,
which were taken possession of bf his widow, and they applied
the proceeds of such sale as pa.rt o the testator's penonal estate,
and they deny being under any liability in respect. of such furniture,
linen, china, and plate. 
8. With respect to the statements in paragraph seven of the
statement of claim, the defendants say that all moneys received by
them, or either of them, on account of the testator's estate, were 
paid by them to their executorship account at the bank of Messrs.
H. and Oo., and until the sale of the testator's real estate took
place as hereinafter mentioned, the balance to their credit was
never greater than was neceesary for the administration of the
trusts of the testator'a will, and they therefore were unable to make
any such investment or accumulation a.a directed by the testator's
will, No moneys belonging to tho testator's estate have ever been
mixed with the moneys of the defendants, or either of them, nor
has any money of the testator's been employed in business since
the testator's decease, except that his share in the said colliery, for
the reason hereinbefore appearing, hl\8 not been got in. 
9. In 187·1, after the plaintiff C.B. had attained her age of 21
years the defendants sold the real estate of the testator for sums
amounting to 15,0801., and no part thereof remains unsold. They 
received the purchase moneys in December, 1874, and on the
day of , 18i5, they paid such proceeds into court to the
credit of this action with the exception of 6001. :r:etained on account
of costs incurred and to be incurred by them.

tbinge, that the defendants should be entitled to the whole carry­ 
ing power of the Mid samahip for the period of four montba eer- 
taln, commencing from the aid let A ugaet, 187 -i, upon a voyage or

a voyage, then the defendants should pay pro NII.a for the hire of 
the ship up to her arri'f'al at Calcutta,and thecompletediscbarge ol
her cargo there. · 
4. The "British Queen" made several voyages in pursuaece of
the said charter-party, and the first three monthly sums of lOOOl. 
each were duly paid. 
o. The period of four months expired on the 1st December,
1874, aud at that time the steamship waa on a voyt\it9 from 
Mauritius to Valcutta. She arrived at Oalcutta on the 18th Deeem­ 
ber1 and the discharge of her cargo there was completed on the
16th December, 187'.

to pay to them the fourth monthly sum of 10001., and a sum of l>OOl. 
for the hire of the steamship from the let to the 16th December,
1874, but the defendants have not paid any part of the said auma.

provided that if any accident should happen to, or any repaira 
should become necesaary to the engines or boilers of the said steam­
ship, the time occupied in repairs should be deducted from the
period of the said charter, and a proportionate reduction in the 
_charter money should be made.
2. On the repairs became necessary to thP engines 
and boilers of the steamship, and ten days were occupied in effect­
ing BUCb rPpairs. 
8. On the an accident happened to the enginee of
t.he steamship at. Mauritius, and two days were occupied in effecting
the repairs necossary in consequence thereof. 
4. The defendanta are therefore ent.itled to a reduction in the
charter mone1 of 400/. 
COtlflUr-claim.-By way of aet-off and counter-claim the
aefendanta claim as follows:- 
6. By the charter-party it was expressly provided that t.he
charterers should furnish funds for tho steamship's nece88&'1 dis­
bursements, except in the port. of Calcutta, witbont aoy oomm1111fon 
or interest on any sum eo advanced. 
6. The defendants paid for the neoeseary disbursements of the
ship fn the port of Mauritius between the and the 
187', sums amounting in all to 625l. U,. 6d.

the ateamabp wu at the date thereof capable of &teaming nine lmot. 
an hour on a oon1umption of 30 toDB of coal a day, and it wu fur­
ther proYided by the eharter party that the charteren should pro­
Tide coal for the oae of the said steamship. 
8. 'l'be ete&msbip wu at the d11te of the charter-party only
capable of steaming 1688 than eight knot.a to an hour, and that only 
on a consumption of tnore than 35 tons of coal a day.
9. Io eonsequenoe of the mattens mentioned ia the lut paragraph 
the steamship finally arrived at Calcutta. at leut 15 days later, an~
Nmained under charter at least 15 d11r9 longer than she woald 
otberwiee have done. She was also dunng the whole period of the
aid charter at &e1\ for a much larger number of days than she
would otherwise ha.Ye been, and consumed a much larger quantity
of coal on each of such days than she would otherwise have done, 
whereby the defendants were obliged to provide for the uao of the
ate&mship much larger quantities of coal than they would otberlrile

plaintiff does not admit the correctness of the amount therein

the said charter, steam more than eight knots an hour, and that on
a consumption of more than 35 tons a day, as alle1red (which the

And between tho said O.S., plaintiff, and the said R. JV., and J.B. 
and J. W., defendants (by counter-claim). 
The &ply of the Plaintiff R. W. 
1. &ply.-The plaintiff joins issue with the defendants upon
their several defences, aud in reply to the statements alleged by 
the defendant O.S . by way of counter claim, the plaintiff says u
follows: 
1. The plaintiff does not admit the execution of any such in­
denture as is stated in the said counter claim to bear date
2·itb of March, 1860. 
2, The plaintiff does not admit that the indenture of the 12th
of May, 1860, is stated correctly iu the statement of 
claim. 
1876. w. 672. 
a. When the defendant O.S., iu tho year 1866, applied to the
plaintiff to advanoe him the sum of 10,000/., he offered to 
the i,laint.iff aa a. security the lauds which were after­
wards comprlsed in tho indenture of the 25th of March,
1867, including the mines and minerals which he now 
alleges were not to form pa.rt of tho security, and the
plaintiff agreed to lend the said sum upon the security of
the said lands, including such mines and minerals.
During the negotiation for the said loan a valuation of
the property to be included in the mortgage was delivered 
to the plaintiff on behalf of the said defeudanL Such
valuation included the mines and minerals ; and the
plaint.iii consented to make the loan on the faith of such
valuation. The plaintiff did not know when be took his
security that it did not include any interest in the said
mines and minerals; on tho contrary, he believed that 
the entirely of such wiueti and miuerals WIUI to be included
therein. 
4. The plaintiff does not admit the contents of the indenture
of the 1st of September, 1866, to be It.ti alleged, vr that it 
was so framed as not to include the said minee and
minerals, or that it was not intended to include anything 
not included in the security of the 12th of .May, 1860, or
that J.L. in the counter claim named only concurred 
therein to signify his approval of the said sale, and did not
purport to convey an7 estate vested in him. 
5. Save so far as the plaintiff's solicitor may have had notice
b:, means of the abstract of title that the mines and 
minerals under the said lands did not belong to the
defendant O.S., the plaintiff had not any notice thereof, 
and he dees not admit that it appeared from the abstract
of title that such was the case. The mines were not
omitted from any valuation delivered to the plaintiff as
mentioned in the counter claim. 
6. The plaintiff admits that when he toot his security he was
aware that there was indorsed on the doed by which the 
said lands were conveyed by J.C.A., in the counter-claim
named a notice of a settlement of 2(th March, 1860, bat
he bad no further or other notice thereof, and though hia 
solicitor inquired after such settlement none was ever
produced. 
7. The plaintiff submits that if it shall appear that no farther
interest in the said mines and minerals was conveyed to 
him by his said security than one undivided moiety of a
term of 600 yeara therein, aa alleged by the said counter 
claim, such interest is effectually included in the plain tiff'
said security, and that ho is entitled to foreclose the
same.

1. Claim.-On or about the 15th of July, 1868, an agreement wae
entered into between the plaintiff and J. D., who was then the sole 
owner of the nbove named barque, "Lady of the Lake," whereby
J.D., agreed to sell, and the pln.intiff agreed to purchase, 32-64t.b
parts or shares of the vessel for the sum of 5001.; payment 3001.
in cash, and the remainder by purchaser's accept.aucos at three And
six months date, and it wna thereby agreed that the plaintiff was
to be commander of the vessel. 
2. The plaintiff accordingly paid to J. D. the sum of 800/., and
gave him bis(the plaintiff's)l\cet'plances at three and six months date 
for the residue of the said purchase money, and J. D. by bill of sale
transferred 8~-64th parts or shares iu the vessel to the plaintiff, 
which bill of sale was duly registered on the 18th of July, 1868;
the plaintiff has since been and still is the registered owner of such
32-64th shares. 
3. The vessel then sailed under the plaintiff's command on a
voyage from Sunderland to the Brazils and other ports, and then 
on a homeward voyage to Liverpool, where she arrived on the 18th
of June, 1869, aad having there discharged her homeward cargo 
she sailed thence under the plaintiff's command with a cargo to
the Tyne, and thence to Sunderland, at which port she arrived on 
the 9th of August. 1869.
4. The plaintiff then made several ineffectual applioationa to 
J. D., wit.ii a view to obtaining another charter for the said vessel, 
and after she had been lying idle for a considerable time, the
plaintiff on or about the 16th of September, 1869, obtained an 
advantageons charter for her to proceed to Barcelona with a cargo
of coals, and wita a view to enabling her to execute such charter
the plaintiif paid the dock dues, and moved the vessel into a slipway 
in order that her bottom might bo cleaned, but on or about the
lith of Septemberl whilst tho vessel wu on the shore adjoining
the slipway, the aefendant, to whom the said J. D. bad in the
meantime transferred his 82-64th r.rts, forcibly took the vessel 
ou,t of the possession of the plainti , and refused and still refuses
to allow the pl&intif[ to take the vessel on her said voyage to
Barcelona, and by reason thereof heavy loss 18 boing occasioned to
tho vlaintiff.

act, and he bas since always acted, as ship's husband of the 
Lady

the sum of 4001., and by bil of sale duly executed, transferred to 
him bis 32· 6-lth shares, and the bill of sale was duly registered on
the 14th of September following. 
4. After the "Lady of the Lake ,, bad arrived at Sunderland, and
after the defendant bad purchased from J. D. his 82-64th shares of 
the "Lady of the Lake;" the defendant placed the vessel in the
custody and possession of a shipkeeper. The plaintiff', however, 
11 
unlawfully removed her from such poeeellrion, and thereupon the
defendant had the vessel taken into \he South Dock of the harbour
at Sunderland, with orders that she should be kept there. What
the defendant did, 11s in thia article mentioned, be did with tbe 
consent and fuU approval of J, D.

1. &J>ly.-The plaintiff says in reply to the first paragraph of
the defence that \he bills therein mentioned were dishonoured by
the plaintiff because J.D. was indebted to the plaintiff in II large
amount for his wages as master, and for his share of the earoillga 
of the "Lady of the Lake," and refused payment thereof.
2. J.D. did not place tho vessel in the exclu.eive custody or pee- 
8088ion of a shipkeeper as in the fifth paragrafh of the defence
stated or implied. On the oontnt.r,:, the vcase continued in tho 
custody and possesaiou of tho plaintiff, who still holds her register.
A man was sent on board the vessel by J.D. to look after J.D.'s 
share in the said vessel while she was ill dock, but he did not dis­ 
po8861!8 the said plaintiff or take exclusive po88tl8Sion of the vessel,

8l,aJ#JJltfflt Of Claim. 
1. Claim.-The "Brazilian" is a screw steamer belonging to the
port of Newcastle, of the burthen of 1869 tons grou regieteied ton­
nage, and propelled by engines of 180 horse power, and at the time 
of the rendering of the aalvage servicea hereinafter mentioned she 
wu navigated by her muter and a crew of twenty-four banda.
Bbe left the port of Newcutle on the 27th of Novomber, 1878, on a. 
voyage to Genoa, and thence by way of Palmaru and Aguilaa to
the Tyne, and about 10 a.m. on the 26th of December, 1873._ in the 
oourae of her homeward voyage, with a cargo of merobanafae, 11he
waa off the coast of Portugal, the laland of Ona bearing about B.E. 
by E., when thoee on board her sighted a disabled steamer about
four points on their starboard bow, in-shore, flying signals of
distress. A strong gale was blowing at the Ume, and there wa.s a 
very heavy sea running.
2. The" Brazilian" at once made towards the disabled steamer, 
which proved to be the "CR.mpanil," the vessel proceeded against
in this action, She was heavily laden with a cargo of iron ore. The 
''Brazilian" u sheaf pro ached the" Oampanil" signalled to her,
and the " Campanil answered by signal that her engines had
broken down. By this time the " Campanil " was heading in­ 
shore, rollinf heavily, and shipping a largequantitl of water. Tbo
'' Brazilian ' ca.me under the lee of the "Campand '' and asked if 
she wanted assistance. Her master replied that be wanted to be
towed to ViJO as hia veesel had loet her screw. The master of tile
" Brazilian ' then asked those on board the "Campanil" to send 
him a hawser, and for a long time those on board the "Brazilian "
made attempts to get a hawser from the "Camp&nil," and exposed 
themselns and their vessel to great danger in doing so. The wind
and sea. rendering it impoesible to get the hawser whilst the 
" Brazilian " was to leeward of the " Campanil," the " Bra.zilian"
went to windward and attempted to float lines by means of life 
buoys to the" Campanil." During all this time the " Campanil "
was quite unmanageable, and yawed about, and there wu very 
great difficulty in manoouvring the " Brazilian " so as to retain
command over her and keep her near the " Campanil" It waa 
neceuary to keep constantly altering the engines of the
" Brazilian,'' setting them on ahead and reversing them quickly, 
and in consequence the engines laboured heavily and were exposed
to great danger of being strained, 
8. Whilst the "Brazilian" was endeavouring to float linea to the
"Camv.anil," the" Campanil" made a sudden lurch and struck the 
"Brazilian" on her port quarter, knocking in her port bulwark
and rail, and e&UBing other damage to the vessel. After many un­ 
successful efforts by those on board the '' Brav.ilian, · and after
they had lost two life buoys and a quantity of rope, a hawser
from the "Oampanil" was at length made fast on board the 
"Br&Y.ili&n," and the ''Brazilian'' wft.h the "Campanil" in tow
steame<l eas7 ahead. A second ha weer was then got out and made
fut with corr springs, and the" Brazilian" then oommenced to tow
full speed ahead, each hawser having a full soope of 90 fathoms. 
i. 'L'he "Brazilian" made towards Vign, which was about 85
miles distant, the vessels made about two knots an hour, \pe
" Brazilian" keeping her engines going at full speed. The
" Brazilian" laboured very heavily, and both vessels snipped large 
quantitit'8 of water.
6. About noon one of the tow ropes broke, and both vessels were 
in danger of being driven ashore, broken water and rocb appearing
to leeward, distant about two miles. After great difficulty the 
broken hawser was mado fast again with a heavy spring of a
number of parts of rope, and the u Brazilian" towed ahead under
the lee of One Island. 
6, Shortly afterwards the weather moderated and the sea went
down a little, and the " Brazilian " waa able to make more way, 
and about 7 p.m. the 11ame day she towed the "Campanil" into
Vigo harbour lo safety. 
7. Tho "Bnzilian" wu compelled to remain in harbour the
next day to pay port chargee and clear at the Custom House. 
8. The coaet off which the aforesaid aervicee were rendered is 
rocky and exceedingly dangerous, and strong ourren ta set along it,
and but for the servioee rendered by the "Brazilian " the u Cam­ 
panil" must have gone ashore and been wholly lost, together with
her cargo, and in all probability her muter and crew would have 
been drowned. No other atcamer wu in sight, and there waa not
any prospect of any other efficient aeaistance. 
9. -in rendering the said servioee the "Brazilian " and those on
board her were exposed to great danger. Owing to the heayY
sea, and the necesaity of towing with a long scope of hawser, there 
waa great danger of fouling the screw of the "Brazilian," and it
required constant vigilance on the part of the muter and crew to. 
prevent serious aooicfenL The muter and crew of the "Bruillan"
underwent much extra fatigue and exertion. 
10. The damage sustained by the" Brazilian" in rendering the
said servicee amount.a to the sum of 1501., and the value of the 
extra quantity of coal consumed in consequence of tbeaaid servioee 
is estimated at 161., and j/. la. od. waa paid by the owners of the
"Brazilian" for harbour duos and other chargee at Vigo. 
11. The value of the "Campanil," her cargo and freight, at the
time of the salvage services were as follows, that is to say: The 
'Camr,anil · wu of the valueof 18,000l., her cargo WM of the value
of 800 , and the groaa amount of freight payable upon delivery of 
the cargo laden oo board her at Barrow-hi-Furness was 6751.
12. The value of the " Brazilian," her freight and cargo wu about 
25 0501.
The plaintiffs claim:- 
1. Buch an amount of salvage as to the court may seem just:
2. That the defendant.a and their bail be condemned in costs: 
8. Buch further or oUler relief aa the nature of the case may
require,

1. De/~-The dofendantsaay that upon the 22nd of December, 
1878, the iron screw steamship "Oampanil," of the burden of 660
tons register gross, propelled by engines of 70 horse power, 
navigated by David Boughtont.. her master, and a crew of 16
hands, left Forman, bound to Harrow-in-Furness, laden with a 
cargo of iron ore.
2. At about 8 a.m. of the 26th of December, whilst the " Cam­ 
psnil " was prosecuting her voyage, the abaft of her propeller broke
outside the stern tube, and she lost her propeller. The "Oam­
panil" was then bi-ought to tho wind, which was south by east,
blowing fresh, and she proceeded under sail for Vigo, and continued 
to do so till about 9.80 a.m., when two steamships which had been
for some time in 11igbt, and coming to the northward, approached 
the "Campanil." The ensign of the " Campanil " was hoisted,
union up, as a signal to one of such steamships, which afterwards 
OAme to the "Campanl)," and proved to be the "Brazilian," whose
ownen, master, and crew an, the plaintiffs. 
8. The 
Brazilian" then signalled the" Campanll" and inquired
what was the matter, and was signalled in reply that the "Oam­ 
11 
panil" had lost her propeller, and required to be towed to Vigo,
upon which the " Brazilian " signalled for the rope of the " Cam. 
panil," in order to take her in tow. After this the "Brazilian ''
steamed round the "Campanil" and up on to her starboard bow, 
and in so doing the " Brazilian " came with her port quarter into
the starboard bow of the " Campanil " and did her considerable 
~~ "Brazilia.n "then threw a heaving line on board the 
panil1" and one of the" Campa.nil's" hawsers was attached to the
line and hauled on board the " Brazilian," which passed one of her
hawsers to the 
Campanil" by means of life buoys, and when such
h.awsors had been secured between the two vessels the" Brazilian" 
II 
commenced to tow the " Campanil " for Vigo, it being at this time 
about 10.30 a.m. and Ona Island then bearing about south east by
south, and dist.ant about 15 miles. 
6. Tho " Brazilian" proceeded with the '' Campanil " in tow,
but owing to the two vessels being laden, and to the small power 
of the "Brazilian," she was only able to make very slow progress
with the '' Oampanil," and it was not until 6.80 p.m. of the said
day that the 
Brazilian" arrived at Vigo with the " Campanil,"
which then came to anchor off the town there.

6. The defendants on the day of

187. No. 
1. Claim.-Tbe plaintiff was on the 5th Ma.rch, 1876, and still i8 
the owner and occupier of a farm called Highfield Farm, in the
pariah of and county of  
2, A private road, known u Highfield Lane, runs through a 
II 
Cam­ 
portion of the plaintiff's farm. It is bounded upon both aides by
fields of the plaintiff's, and is separated therefrom by 11, hedge and
ditch. 
3. For a long time prior to the 5th March, 1876, the defena&nt
had wrongfully claimed to 1188 the said road for bis horses and 
oarriage8 on the allepd ground that the same was a public high­ 
way, and the -plaintiff bad frequently warned him that the same
waa not a public highway, but the plaintiff's private road, and that 
the defendant must not so use it. 
4. On the 5th March, 1876. the defendant came with a. cart and
hone, and a large number of servanta and workmen, and forcibly
used the road, and broke down and removed a gate which the 
plaintiff bad caused to be placed across the aame.
6. The defendant and his servants and workmen on the l!l&Dle 
occasion pulled down and damaged the plaintiff'& hedge and ditch
upon each aide of the road, and went upon the plaintiff's field 
beyond the hedge and ditch, and injured the crops there growing,
and dug up and injured the soil of the road; and in any ease the 
acta mentioned in this paragraph were wholly nnnece11S&ry for the
assertion of the defendant's alleged right to use, or the user of the
said road aa a highway. 
Tho plaintiff claims :
1. Damages for the wrongs complained of.
2. An injunction restraining the defendant from any repetition 
of any of the acts complained of.
3. Such further relief as the nature of the oase may require. 
[Title.]
&auJmml of Defence. 
L Dtf~.-The defendant 1&ys that the road was and is a
public highway for horses and carriages; and a few days before 
the 6th March, 1876, the plaintiff wron~ully erected the gate
aero the road for the purpose of obstructing and preventing, and
it did obstruct and prevent the uee of the road as a highway. And
the defendant on the said 6th March, 1876, caused the l&id gate to 
be removed, in order to enable him lawfully t.o use the roadl>y his 
horses and carriages as a highway. 
2. The defendant denies the allegations of the fifth paragraph of
the statement of claim, and says that neither he nor any of his 
workmen or servants did any act, or used any violen".e other than 
was neoeesary to enable the plaintiff lawfully to use the highway.
