proceed against the defendant or defendants served, in the same.
manner as if such defendant or defendants were the only parties

tion may be made by any person acquainted with the facts, The
verification may be omitted when an admission of tho truth of
the allegations might subject the parties to prosecution for felony.
And no pleading can be used in a criminal prosecution against
the party as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such pleadings. 
SEC. 20. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth
in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged, but he 
shall deliver to the adverse party, within ten days after a demand
thereof in writing, a copy of the account, which, if the pleading
is verified, must be verified by his own oath, or that of his agent
or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of such agent or
attorney, to the effect that ho believes it to be true, or be pre- 
eluded from giving evidence thereof. The court, or a judge
thereof, or a county judge, may order a further account when
the one delivered is defective ; and the court may in all cases
order a bill of particulars of the claim of either party to Le 
furnished, 
SEC. 21. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally con- 
strued with a view to substantial justice between the parties. 
SEC. 22. If irrelevant and redundant matter be inserted
in a pleading, it may be stricken out on motion of any perrnn 
aggrieved thereby; and when the allegations of a pleading are
so indefinite or uncertain, that tlte precise nature of' the charge
or defense is not apparent, the court may require the pleading
to be made definite and certain by amendment. 
SEC. 23. In pleading a judgment or other determination 
or o. court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be neces­
sary to state the facts conferriug jurisdiction, but such judgment
or determination may be stated to ham been duly given or made. 
If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be
bound to establish on the trial the facts conferring jurisdiction. 
SEC. 24. In pleading the performance of conditions pre­
cedcnt in a contract, it shall uot be necessary to state the facts 
showing such performance, but it may be stated generally that
the party duly performed all the conditions on his part, and if 
such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be
bound to establish 011 the trial the facts showing such perform­
ance. In an action or defense founded upon an instrument for 
the payment of money only, it shall be sufficient for the party
to give a copy of the instrument, and to state that there is due
to him thereon, from the adverse party, a specified mm which
he claims. 
SEC. 25. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived
therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its title and the day of its passage, and the court shall thereupon
take judicial notice thereof. 
SEC. 26. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be
necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the 
purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defam-
atory matters out of which the came of action arose ; but it
shall be sufficient to state generally that the same was published
or spoken concerning the plaintiff, and if such allegation lie
controverted, the plaintiff shall be bound to establish on trial
that it was so published or spoken. 
SEC. 27. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the
defendant may in his answer allege both the truth of the matter 
charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to
reduce the amount of damages ; and whether he prove the
justification or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating
circumstances. ' 
SEC. 28. In an action to recover the possession of property 
distrnincd, doing damage, an answer that the defendant or
person by whose command he acted was lawfully possessed of 
the real property upon which the distress was made, and that
the pl'opcrty distraiued was at the time doing damage thereon, 
shall be good without setting forth the title to such real
property. 
SEC. 29. The plaintiff may unite in the same complaint
several ca.uses of action, whether they be such as have been 
" d · d gal · 
heretofore enominate le or equitable, or both, where they
arise out of- 
t. The same transaction or transactions connected with the
same subject. or action. 
2. Contract, express or implied. 
3. Injuries, with or without evidence, to person or property,
or either ; or- 
4. Injuries to character ; or- 
5. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages,
for the withholding thereof, and the rents and profits of the
same; or- 
6. Claims to recover personal property, with or without dam-
ages, for tho withholding thereof; or- . 
7. Claims against a trustee by virtue of a. contract, or by
operation oflaw. 
SEC. 30. But the causes of action so united must all
belong to one of theso classes, and must affect all the parties to
the action, and not require different places of trial, and must be 
stated respectively. 
SEC. 31. Every material allegation of the complaint, not
controverted by the answer, as prescribed in section ten of this chapter, and every material allegation of new matter in the 
answer constituting a counter claim, not controverted by the
reply, as prescribed in section fifteen of this chapter, shall, for
the purpose~ of the action, be taken as true. 
SEC. 32. But the allegation of new matter in the answer,
not relating to a counter claim, or of new matter in a reply, is 
to e eeme controverted by the adverse party as upon a direct
denial or avoidance, as the case may require. 
SEC. 33. No variance between the allegation in a pleading
and the proof shall be deemed material, unless it shall actually 
mislead the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his
action or defense upon its merits. Whenever it shall be alleged
that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved to the
satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has been misled,
and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended
upon such terms as may be just. 
SEC. 34. When the variance is not material, as provided
in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found in 
accordance with the evidence, or may order an immediate amend-
ment without costs. 
SEC. 35. When, however, the allegation of the cause of
action or defense to which tho proof is directed, is improved, 
not in some particular or particulars only, but in its entire scope
and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of variance within
tho last two sections, but a failure or proof. 
SEC. 36. Any pleading may be once amended by the
party, of course, without costs and without prejudice to the pro- 
ceeding already had, at any time before the period for answering 
it expires, or it can be so amended at any time within twenty 
days after the service of the answer or demurrer to' such plead­
ings, unless it be made to appear to the court that it was done
for the purpose of delay, and the plaintiff or defendant will
thereby lose the benefit of a term or circuit for which it is or
may be noticed ; and if it appear to the court that such amend­
ment was made for that purpose, the same may be stricken out
and such terms imposed as to the court may seem just. In such
case a copy of the amended pleading must be served on the
adverse party. After the decision of a demurrer, either at a
general or special term, the court may, in its discretion, 'if i\ 
appear that the demurrer was interposed in good faith, allow the 
party to plead on such . terms as may seem just. If tho
demurrer be allowed for the cause mentioned in the fifth subdi­ 
'Vision of section five of this chapter, the court may, in its dis­
cretion, and upon such terms as may be just, order the action to
be divided into as · many actions as may be necessary to the 
proper determination of the cause of action therein men tioncd. 
SEC. 87. The court may before or after judgment, in fur­
therance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, 
amend any pleading or proceedings, by adding or striking out
the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake· in the name 
of -a party, or a mistake in- any other respect, or by inserting
other allegations material to the case, or when the amendment
does not change substantially the claim or defense, by conform­
ing the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved. 
SEC. 38. The court may likewise in its discretion, and
upon such terms as may be just, allow an answer or reply to bo 
made, or .other act to be done, after the time limited by this chapter, or by an order enlarge such time; and may also in its
discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, at any time
within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judg­
ment, order, or other proceeding against him, through his mis­
take, inadvertence, or surprise, or excusable neglect, and may
supply an omission in any proceedings ; and whenever any pro­
ceeding taken by a party fails to conform, in any respect, to the
provisions of law, the court may, in like manner and upon like
terms; permit an amendment of such proceedings so· as to· make 
it conformable thereto. 
SEC. 89. When the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name
of· a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any plead­ 
ing or proceeding by any name, and when his true name shall
be· discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended
accordingly. 
SEC. 40. The court shall, in every stage of an action, disro­
gard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which shall 
not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party ; and no
judgment shall be reversed or affected by reason of such · error 
or defect. 
SEC. 41. The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may
be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint, an­ 
swcr, or reply, alleging facts material to the case, occurring after
the former complaint, demurrer, reply, or of which the party
was ignorant when his former pleading was made. 
SEC. 42. When two or more actions are pending in the
same court, which might have been joined, the defendant may
move the court, or the judge thereof in vacation, to consolidate
such actions; and if no sufficient cause be shown against
it, such actions shall be consolidated. 
CHAPTER CXXVI. 
OF SET-OFFS Al\'1> TENDER. 
SEC. 1. In the following cases and under the following
circumstances, a defendant may set off demands which he has 
against the plaintiff:-
. 1. It must be a demand arising upon judgment or upon con- 
tract, express or implied, whether such contract be written or
unwritten, sealed or without a seal ; and if it be founded upon
a bond or other contract having a penalty, the sum equitably
due by virtue of its conditions only shall be set off. 
2. It must be due to him in his own right, either as being
the original creditor or payee, or as being the assignee and
owner of the demand. 
3. It must have existed at the time of the commencement of
the action, and must then have belonged to the defendant. 
4. It can be allowed only in actions founded upon demands
which could themselves be the subject-of set-off according to law. 
5. If the action be founded upon a contract, other than a
negotiable promissory note or bill of exchange, which has been
assigned by the plaintiff, a demand existing against such plaintiff,
or any assignee or such contract, at the time of the assignment,
thereof, and belonging to the defendant in good faith, before·
notice of such assignment, may be set off to the amount of the
plaintiff's debt, if the demandbe such as might have been set off'
against such plaintiff, or such assignee, while the contract
belonged to him. 
6. IC action be upon a negotiable promissory note or bill or
exchange, which has been assigned to the plaintiff after it beoame 
due, a set-off to the amount of the plaintiff's debt may be made or
a demand existing against any person or persons who shall have
assigned or transferred such note or bill aftier it became due, if 
the demand be such as might have been set off against the
assignor while the note or bill belonged to him. . 
If the plaintiff be a trustee for any other, or a person
expressly authorized by statute to prosecute such action, so much
of ~ demand existing against those whom the plaintiff represents,
or for whose benefit the action is brought, may be set off, as will
satisfy the plaintiff's debt, if the same might have been set off in
an action by those beneficially interested. 
SEC. 2. If the amount of a set-off duly established, be
equal to the plaintiff's debt or demand, judgment shall be entered 
that the plaintiff take nothing by his action ; if it be less than
the pla.intiff's debt or demand, the plaintiff shall have judgment
for the residue only. 
SEC. 3. If there be found a balance due from the plaintiff
in the action to the defendant, judgment shall be rendered to the
defendant for the amount thereof; but 110 such judgment shall 
be rendered against the plaintiff for any balance due from any
other person. 
SEC. 4. In actions brought by executors and administra­
tors, demands existing against their testators or intestates, and
belonging to the defendant at the time of their death, may be
set off by the defendant, in the same manner as if the action had
been brought by and in the name of the deceased. 
SEC. 5. Whenever a set-off is established in an action
brought by executors or administrators, if judgment be rendered
against them, the judgment shall be against them in their repre- 
sentative character, and shall be evidence of a debt established
to be paid in the course of administration, but execution shall
not issue thereon, until directed by the judge of tho county
court who granted letters testamentary or of administration. 
SEC. 6. In actions against executors and administrators, 
an against trustees an ot iers, sue m t ieir representative
character, the defendants may set off demands belonging to their
testators or intestates, or those whom thoy represent, in the
same manner as tho persons so represented would have been
entitled. to set off the same in an action against them. 

SEC. 7. The payment or tender of payment of the whole 
sum due on any contract for the payment of money, although
made after the money bas become due and payable, may be 
pleaded to an action subsequently brought, in like manner and
with the like effect as if such tender or payment had been
made at the time prescribed in the contract. 
SEC. 8. Nothing herein contained shall prevent any person
from bringing any action for the breach of any covenant or 
other contract, instead of suing for the penalty by which the
performance of the covenant or contract may have been secured. 
SEC. 9. A tender may also be made after an action is
brought on such contract, of the whole sum due thereon, with 
the legal costs of suit incurred up to the time, provided it be 
made four days at least before the return day of the original
process. 
SEC. 10. The tender last mentioned may be made either
to the plaintiff or to his attorney in the action, and if not 
accepted, the defendant may plead in like manner as if it had
boon made before the commencement of the action, bringing 
into court the money so tendered for costs as well as for debt or
damages. 
SEC. 11. If such tender is accepted, the plaintiff or bis
attorney shall, at the request of the defendant, sign a certificgte 
or notice thereof, to the officer who has the process, and sllall
deliver it to the defendant; and if any further costs shall be
incurred for any service made by the officer after the tender and
before he receives notice thereof, the defendant shall pay the 
same to the officer, or tho tender shall be invalid. 
SEC. 12. A tender may also ho made in all cases or 
iuvoluutary trespass, before action is commenced; and when in
the opinion of the court or jury a sufficient amount was tendered 
to the party injured, his agent or attorney, for the trespass com·
plained of, judgment shall be entered against the plaintiff for
costs: provided, that the defendant kept his tender good, by
paying the money into court at the trial for tho use of the
plaintiff:

further time as may be granted by the court. 
SEC. 16. Within the time limited for that purpose, tho

residence and occupations of the latter,) before a judge of the
court, or county judge, or justice of the peace, at a specified time
and place ; the time to be not less than five nor more than ten
days thereafter. In case other bail be given, there shall be a

than two bail to justify severally in amounts less than that
expressed in the order, if the whole justification be equivalent to
that of two sufficient bail. 
SEC. 19. For the purpose: of justification, each of the bail
shall attend before the judge, or a justice of the peace, at the
time and place , mentioned in the notice, and may be examined
on oath, on the part of· the plaintiff, touching his sufficiency, in
such manner as the judge or justice of the peace in his discretion·
may think proper. The. examination shall be reduced to writing,
and subscribed bythe bail, if required ,by the plaintiff. 
SEC. 20. If too judge· or justice of the peace find the bail

the court, and the sheriff shall thereupon be exonerated from
liability.

SEC. 22. The sheriff shall, within four days after the
deposit, pay the same into court, and shall take from the officer 
receiving the same two certificates of payment, the one of which
he shall deliver to the plaintiff, and the other to the defendant.
For any default in making such payment, the same proceedings
ma.y be had on the official bond of the sheriff to collect the sum
deposited, as in other cases of delinquency. 
SEC. 23. If money be deposited as provided in the last 
two sec ions, ai may e given an justi e upon notice, as pre-

payment of money to the plaintiff, the clerk shall, under the
direction of the court, apply the same iu satisfaction thereof, and
after satisfying the judgment, shall refund the surplus, if any, to
the defendant. If the judgment be in favor of the defendant, tho
clerk shall refund to him the whole sum deposited and remaining
unapplied, 
SEC. 25. If after being arrested the defendant escape or
be rescued, or bail be not given or justified, or a deposit be not
made instead thereof, the sheriff shall himself be liable as bail.
But he may discharge himself from such liability by the giving
and justification of bail, as provided in sections seventeen,
eighteen, nineteen, and twenty of this chapter, at any time before
process against the person of the defendant to enforce an order
or judgment in the action. 
SEC. 26. If a judgment be recovered against a sheriff
upon his liability as bail, and an execution thereon be returned 
unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the same proceedings may be
had on the official bond of the sheriff to collect the delinquency,
as in other cases of delinquency. 
SEC. 27. The bail taken upon the arrest shall, unless they
justify or other bail be given or justified, be liable to the sheriff
by action for damages which he may sustain by reason of such
omission.

arrest, or to reduce the amount of bail. 
SEC. 29. If the motion be made upon affidavit on the part
of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintiff may oppose tho
same by affidavit or other proof, in addition to those on which

tics approved by the sheriff, to the effect that they are bound in
double the value of the property as stated in the affidavit for the
prosecution of the action, for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return thereof be adjudged, and for the payment to
him of such sum as may for any cause be recovered against tho
plaintiff, the sheriff shall forthwith take the property described in
the affidavit, if it be in the possession of the defendant or his
agent, and retain it in his custody. He shall, also, without
delay, serve on the defendant a copy of the affidavit, notice, and
undertaking, by delivering the same to him personally, if he can

to them. When the defendant excepts, the sureties shall justify,
on notice, in like manner as upon hail on arrest. .And the
sheriff shall be responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties
until the objection to them is either waived as above provided,
or until they justify, or new sureties shall be substituted and
justify. If the defendant except to the sureties, he cannot re-
claim the property as provided in tho next section. 
SEC. 6. At o.ny time before the delivery of the property 
to the plaintiff, the defendant may, if he do not except to the
sureties of the plaintiff, require the return thereof upon giving

CHAPTER CXXXII. 
OF ISSUES, MODE OF TRIAL, .AND JUDGMENT IN CITIL ACTIONS. 
SEC. 1. Issues arise upon the pleadings when ~ fact or
conclusion of law is maintained by one party and controverted 
by the other ; they arc of two kinds. 
1. Of law. 
2. Of fact. 
SEC. 2. An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to the 
complaint, answer, or reply, or to some part thereof. 
SEC. 3. An issue of fact arises :- 
1. Upon a material allegation in the complaint controverted
by the answer ; or- 
2. Upon new mutter in the answer controverted by the reply ;
or- 
3. Upon new matter in the reply, except an issue of law is
joined thereon. 
SEC. 4. Issues both of law and of fact may arise upon
different parts of the pleadings in the same action ; in such
cases the issue of law must be first tried, unless the court other-
wise direct. \ 
SEC. 5. A trial is the judicial examination of tl1e issues
between the parties, whether they be issues of law or qf fact. 
SEC. 6. An issue of law must be tried by t,. e court,
unless it be referred as provided in section twcnty-tw of this chapter. An issue of fact in an action for the re overy of
money only, or of specific real or personal property or for a
divorce from the marriage contract on the ground of dultery,
must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived], as pro­
vided in section eighteen of this chapter. Every othejr issue is
triable by the court, which, however, may order the wh!Jole issue,
or any specific question of fact involved therein, to bd: tried by
a jury, or may refer it as provided in section twonty-twi o of this chapter: provided, when in an action for the recovery o~: specific
real property, tho defendant in his answer shall set up aill._ equit­
able defense, and shall also by his answer claim affir~:~
relief against the plaintiff, an issue of fact found upon a denial
of the allegations contained in such answer, shall be triable by '- 
the court, unless otherwise ordered. 
SEC. 7. The clerk shall prepare a calendar of issues for
each term of the circuit court, which shall contain the title of 
eachaction pending, in which an answer or demurrer has been
filed ten days before the term, the names of the attorneys, and 
the time when the last pleading was filed; andall appeals shall
he deemed to be at issue from tho day of the filing of tho returns 
in such appeal. 
SEC. 8. The issues on the calendar shall be disposed of
in the following order, unless for the convenience of parties or
the dispatch of business the court shall otherwise direct. 
1. Issues of fact to be tried by a jury.
2. Issues of fact to be tried by the court.
3. Issues of law. 
SeC. 9. Either party may bring the issue to trial, and in
the absence of the adverse party, unless the court for good 
cause otherwise direct, may proceed with his case, and take a
dismissal of the complaint, or a verdict, or a judgment, as the 
case m,1y require. A separate trial between the plaintiff and
any of the several defendants may ho allowed by the court,
whenever in its opinion justice will be thereby promoted. 
SEC. 10. A general verdict is that by which the jury pro-
nounce generally upon all or any of the issues, either in favor
of the plaintiff or defendant. A special verdict is that by 
which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judgment to the
court. 
SEC. 11. In an action for the recovery of specific personal
property, if the property have not been delivered to the plaintiff, 
or the defendant by his answer claim a return thereof, the jury
shall assess the value of the property, if their verdict be in 
favor of the plaintiff, or if they find in favor of the defendant
that he is entitled to a return thereof, and may at the same
time assess the damages, if they are claimed in the complaint
or answer, which the prevailing party has sustained by reason
of the detention, or taking and withholding such property. In 
every action for the recovery of money only, or specific real
property, the jury in their discretion may render a. general or
special verdict. In all other cases the court may direct the jury
to find a special verdict in writing, upon all or any of the issues,
and in all cases may instruct them, if they render a general
verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact, to be stated in
writing, and may direct a written finding thereon. The special
verdict or finding shall be filed with the clerk and entered upon
the minutes. 
SEC. 12. Whenever, on the trial of any cause in the
c!r~uit. court, either party shall .request it, the. judge pre- 
siding in such court shall reduce Ins charge to the Jury empan-
neled in such cause to writing, before giving the same to such 
jury; and if any such judge shall give any charge to a jury on
the trial of any cause when so requested, without the same· be in 
writing, it shall be sufficient cause for reversing on appeal or 
error to the supreme court, the judgments which may lie ren-
dered therein. 
SEC. 13. As soon as any such charge sha],l lte.ve, been
given, the same shall be placed and remain on file among the 
records and papers of the case in which it was given .. 
SEC. 14. When a special finding of facts. shall be incon- 
latter, and the court shall give judgment accordingly. 
SEC. 15. When a verdict is found for the plaintiff in an
action for the recovery of money, or for the defendant when a
sot-off for the recovery of money is established beyond tho 
amount of the plaintiff's claim as established, the jury must 
assess the amount of the recovery : they may also, under the
direction of the court, assess the amount of the recovery when
the court give judgment for the plaintiff on the answer. If a
set-off, established at the trial, exceed the plaintiff's demand so
established, judgment for the defendant must be given for tho
excess; 'orif it appear that the defendant is entitled to any other
affirmative relief, judgment must be given accordingly. 
SEC. 16. Upon receiving a verdict, the clerk shall make
an entry in his minutes, specifying the time and place of tho 
trial, the names of the jurors and witnesses, the verdict, and
either the judgment rendered thereon, or an order that the
cause be reserved for argument or further consideration. If a. 
different direction ho not given by the court, the clerk must
enter judgment in conformity with the verdict. If an exception
be taken, it may be reduced to writing at the time, or entered
in the judge's minutes, and afterward settled as provided by the
rules of the court, and then stated. in writing, in a case or sepa­
rately, with so much of the evidence as may be material to the
questions to be raised, but need not be sealed or signed, nor
need a bill of exceptions be made. If the exceptions be in the
first instance stated in a case, and it be afterward necessary to
separate them, the separation may be made under the direction 
of the court or a judge thereof. The judge who tries the cause
may in his discretion entertain a motion to be made on his 
minutes, to sot aside a verdict, and grant a new trial, upon
exceptions, or for insufficient evidence, or for excessive damages;

summons against the defendant or defendants, or against one or
moro of the several defendants, in the cases provided for in section eleven of chapter one hundred and twenty-four of the 
revised statutes. But if the complaint be not sworn to, and

amount which the plo.intiff is entitled to recover in such action
from his examination under oath, or other proof, and enter tho

court may take the account, or hear the proof, or mo.y in its dis­
cretion order a. reference for that purpose. And when the
action is for the recovery of money only, or of specific real or
personal property, with damages for the withholding thereof, the
court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury, or if the
examination of a long account be involved, by a reference as 
above provided. Iu case the defendant give notice of appear- 
ance in the action before the expiration -of the time for answer-
ing, he shall be entitled to eight days' notice of the time and 
place of application to tho court for the relief demanded by the
complaint.

cation, the plaintiff may in like manner apply for judgment, and 
the conrt shall thereupon cause proof to be taken of the demand
mentioned in the complaint, and in case the defendant is a non- 
resident, shall cause the plaintiff or his agent to be examined on
oath, as to any payment that may have been made to such plain-
tiff, or to any one for his use 011 account of such. demand, and
may render judgment for the amount which he is entitled to
recover; and before entering judgment the court may in its dis-
cretion require tho plaintiff to cause to be filed satisfactory
security to abide the order of the court touching the restitution
of any estate or effects which may be directed by such judgment 
to be transferred or delivered, or the restitution of any money
that may be collected under or by virtue of such judgment, in
case the defendant or his representatives shall apply and hp 
admitted to defend the action and shall succeed in such defense.
4. In an action arising on a contract for the recovery of 
money only, if the answer of the defendant, either expressly or
by not denying, admits any part of the plaintiff's claim to ho 
. 'f 1 t l · ff t l".

amount less than the plaintiff's claim, and contains no other 
defense to the action, the clerk, on the application of tho plain-
tiff, shall enter judgment for the amount so admitted, or for the
amount claimed in the summons, after deducting the amount of 
the defendant's counter claim or off set: notice of such applies-
tion shall be given to the defendant.at least five days before the
samo is ma.de. Execution shall be issued upon such judgment
in the manner provided in subdivision one of this section. 
SEC. 28. If a demurrer, answer, or reply he frivolous, the
party prejudiced thereby, upon a previous notice of five days,
ma.y apply to a judge of the court, either in or out of the 
court, for judgment thereon, and judgment may be given
accordingly. 
SEC. 29. The relief granted to the plaintiff if there be no
answer, cannot exceed tha.t which he shall have demanded in his
complaint; but in any other case the court may grant him any
relief consistent with tho case made by the complaint and em-
braced within the issue. 
SEC. 30. Whenever damages are recoverable, tho plaintiff
may claim and recover, if he show himself entitled thereto, any 
rate of damages which he might have heretofore recovered for
the same cause of action. 
SEC. 31. In an lction to recover the possession of per- 
sonal property, judgment for the plaintiff may be for the posses- 
sion, or for the recovery of possession, or the value thereof, in case
a delivery cannot be had, and of damages for the detention. If

return of the property, or the value thereof in case a return can- 
not be had, and damages for taking and withholding tho sa~e.

proceedings, dispose of any portion of his property not exempt
from execution, In default of entering into such undertaking,
ho may be committed to prison by warrant of the judge, as for a
contempt. Xo person shall, on examination pursuant to this chapter, be excused from answering any question on the ground
that his examination will tend to convict him of the commission
of a fraud, but his answer shall not be used as evidence against
him in any criminal proceeding or prosecution. 
SEC. 90. After the issuing of execution against property,
any person indebted to the judgment debtor may y,ay to the 
sheriff the amount of his debt, or EO much thereof as shall be
necessary to satisfy the execution, and the sheriff's receipt shall

SEC. 91. After the issuing or return of an execution
against property of the judgment debtor or any one of several
debtors in the same judgment, and upon an affida,;t that any

may by an order require such person or corporation, or any 
officer or member thereof, to appear at a specified timo and

the suit of the surviving plaintiff, or against the surviving de­
fendant, as the case may be.

ants shall die before final judgment, the action may he prose-

SEC. 11. When any action is brought by or in the name
of any public officer or by any trustee appointed by virtue of

cessor who might have originally commenced and prosecuted
the like action. 
SEC. 12. Whenever the death of a person shall be caused
by a wrongful act, neglect, or default, and the act, neglect, or 
default is such as would (if death had not ensued) have enti-

who or the corporation which would have been liable, if death
had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwith-

SEC. 8. It shall not be necessary for the plaintiff to prove
an actual entry under title, nor the actual receipt of any profits 
of the premises demanded, but it shall be sufficient for him to
show a right to the possession of such premises at the time of the 
commencement of the action, as heir, devisee, purchaser, or
otherwise. 
SEC. 9. It shall not be necessary on tho trial for the
defendant to confess, nor for the plaintiff to prove, lease, entry, 
and ouster, or either of them, except as provided in the next sec-
tion ; but this section shall not be construed to impair nor in any 
way to affect any of the rules of evidence now in force in regard 
to the maintenance and defense of the action. 
SEC. 10. If the action be brought by one or more tenants
in common, or joint tenants, against their co-tenants, the plaintiff,
in addition to all other evidence which he may be bound to give, 
shall be required to prove, on the trial of the cause, that the
defendant actually ousted such plaintiff, or did some other act
amounting to a total denial of his right as such co-tenant. 
SEC. 11. If the action be brought against several defend-
ants, and a joint possession of all be proved, the plaintiff shall be 
entitled to a verdict against all, whether they shall have
answered separately or jointly. 
SEC. 12. When the action is against several defendants,
if it appear on the trial that any of them occupy distinct parcels 
in severalty or jointly, and that other defendants possess other
parcels in severalty or jointly, the plaintiff shall elect at tho
trial against which he will proceed, which election shall be made
before the testimony in the cause shall be deemed closed, and
a verdict shall thereupon be rendered for the defendants not so
proceeded against. 
SEC. 13. The plaintiff in any action for the recovery of
specific real property, or of the possession, shall also be entitled 
in the same action to recover damages for the rents and profits
of the premises recovered, during the time the same are uulaw-
fully withheld. But if the action is brought for the recovery of
the dower, the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover such damages
as the court and jury deem proper. Provided, that the plaintiff
shall not be entitled to recover the rents and profits of the prem-
ises recovered, for a longer term than six years. 
SEC. 14. In the following cases the verdict shall be ren-
de red as follows:- 
1. If it be shown on the trial that all the plaintiffs have a. 
right to recover the possession of the premises, the verdict in
that respect sho'll be for the plaintiffs generally. 
2. Ir it appear that one or more of the plain tiffs have a right 
to the possession of the premises, and that one or more have not
such right, the verdict shall specify for which plaintiff the jury
find, and as to which plaintiff they find for the defendant. 
3. If the verdict be for any plaintiff and there be several
defendants, the verdict shall be rendered against such of them as
were in possession of the premises, or as claimed title thereto, at
the commencement of the action. 
4. If the verdict be for all the premises claimed, as specified
in the complaint, it shall in that respect be for such premises
generally. 
5. If the verdict be for a part of the premises described in
such complaint, the verdict shall particularly specify such part,
as the same shall have been proved, with the same certainty
hereinbefore required in the complaint, in the description of' the
premises claimed. 
6. If the verdict be for an undivided share or interest in the
premises- claimed, it shall specify such share or interest, and if 
for an undivided share in part of the premises claimed, it shall
specify such share and shall describe such part of the premises
as hercinbefore required. 
7. The verdict shall also specify the estate which shall have
been established on the trial by the plaintiff in whose favor it
shall be rendered, whether such estate be in fee for his own life 
or for the life of another, stating such lives, or whether it be a
term for years, and specifying the duration of such term. 
SEC. 15. In all cases where the jury find the plaintiff is
entitled to recover the lands claimed, or any estate, share, or
interest therein, the same jury shall assess the plaintiff's dama­ 
ges for the unlawful withholding of the premises, including the
mesne profits received by defendant in cases where plaintiff is 
entitled to recover such mesne profits. 
SEC. 16. On the trial of such action the defendant shall
have the same right to set off permanent improvements made on 
the premises, to the amount of the plaintiff's claim, as is now
allowed by law. And in estimating the plaintiff's damages, the
value of the use by the defendant of any improvements made
by him shall not bo allowed to the plaintiff.

of the withholding of the premises by the defendant, to be
assessed, and that as to the premises claimed, the defendant go 
thereof without day .
SEC. 18. In cases where no other provision is made, the 
judgment in the action, if the plaintiff prevail, shall be that the
plaintiff recover the possession of the premises according to the
verdict of the jury, if there was such verdict, or if the judgment
be by default, according to the description thereof in· the com­
plaint, with costs to be taxed. 
SEC. 19. F.Rcry judgment in the action for the recovery
of specific real property, or of the possession thereof, rendered 
upon verdict, shall be conclusive as to the title established. in
such action, upon the party against whom the same is rendered, 
and against all persons claiming from, through, or under such
party, by title accruing after the commencement of such action,
subject to the exceptions hereinafter contained. 
SEC. 20. The court in which such judgment shall be ren-
dered, at any time within one year thereafter, upon the applica- 
tion of the party against whom the same was rendered, his heirs
or assigns, and upon payment of all costs recovered thereby,
shall vacate such judgment and grant a new trial in such cause.
But no more than one new trial shall be granted under this section. 
SEC. 21. Every judgment in such action rendered upon
the defendant's failure to answer, shall, from and after two years 
from the time of docketing the same, be conclusive upon the
defendant and upon all persons claiming from or through him 
by title accruing after the commencement of the action. But
within two years after the docketing of such judgment, on the
application of the defendant, his heirs or assigns, and upon pay-
men t of all costs and damages recovered thereby, the court shall

some conviction of a criminal offense, for any term less than for 
life; or-
4. A. married woma.n,-

be deemed any portion of the said two years ; but any such
person may bring an action for tho recovery of such premises
after that time, and within two years after such disability shall
be removed, but not after that period. 
SEC. 23. If the person entitled to commence such action
shall die during the continuance of any disability specified in 
tho preceding section, and no determination or judgment be had
of or upon the t~le, right, or action so to him accrued, his heirs
may commence such action after the time above limited for that
purpose, and within two years after his death. 
SEC. 24. If the plaintiff shall have taken possession of
the premises by virtue of any recovery in such action, such pos- 
.session shall not in any way be affected by the vacating of any
judgment as herein provided; and if the defendant recover in 
any new trial hereby authorized, he shall be entitled to an exe-
cution in the same manner as if he was plaintiff. 
SEC. 25. Upon vacating any judgment, as provided in section twenty-one, the defendant shall answer the complaint as
bereinbefore provided ; and upon any new trial granted as herein
provided, the defendant may show any matters in bar of a. 
vacancy, which he might show to entitle him to the possession
of the premises, if ho were plain tiff in the action. 
SEC. 26. If the action be brought to recover the dower
of any widow, which shall not have been admeasured to her 
before the commencement of such action, instead of an execu­
tion being issued, such plaintiffs shall proceed to have her dower 
assigned to her in manner following :-

upon the motion of the plaintiff, shall appoint three reputable
and disinterested freeholders, commissioners for the purpose of
making admeasurement of the dower of the plaintiff out of the
lands described in the record, and the commissioners so appointed
shall proceed immediately to the discharge of their duties. 
2. The report of the commissioners may be appealed from by
any party to the action. 
3. Upon the confirmation of the report of the commissioners,
an execution shall be issued to the sheriff' of the proper county,

ing the sheriff to put the plaintiff in possession thereof. 
SEC. 27. The costs and expenses incurred in such
admeasurement of dower shall be subject to the order of the ,
court. 
SEC. 28. No action shall be maintained by a mortgagee,
or his assigns or representatives, for the recovery of the posses­ 
sion of the mortgaged premises, until the equity of redemption
shall have expired. 
SEC. 29. Any person having the possession and legal title­
to land may institute an action against any other person setting
up a claim thereto, and if the plaintiff shall be able to substan­
tiate his title to such land, the defendant shall be adjudged to 
release to the plaintiff all claim thereto, and to pay costs; unless
the defendant shall, by his answer, disclaim all title to such
land, and give a release to the plaintiff, in which case the defend­
ant shall be entitled to costs, except the court, on a hearing of
the cause, shall otherwise order or adjudge. 
SEC. 30. Whenever any person claims title to any lands
or town lots and tenements under through or by virtue of any 
' 
deed or conveyance heretofore executed or hereafter to be exe-
cuted, by any officer authorized by the laws of this state to exe- 
cute the same, on account of any sale of any lands or town lots
and tenements for the payment of any tax heretofore or here­
after lawfully assessed thereon, or who shall claim title in fee
simple, under or by virtue of a deed from any other officer or per­
son, and an action to recover such lands and town lots or tene­
ments shall be instituted by any person claiming title from any
other source, on the trial of such action, if the jury to whom the
cause is submitted shall find the plaintiff entitled to such lands and
tenements so claimed, an execution shall be awarded by the
court, provided no permanent and valuable improvements have
been made on such lands and tenements in good faith by the
defendant, or those under whom he claims, since the execution
of such deed, or since the execution of a like deed to those
from whom he claims as aforesaid, and before the commence­
ment of said action. 
SEC. 31. If the defendant in any such action, against
whom a verdict may be found, shall claim that he or any person 
or persons throuzh whom he claims title has in good faith since 
. o ' ' 
the execution of such deed or deeds, and before the commence-
meut of said action made valuable and permanent improve- 
men ts on the said lands or town lots, the court in which the said
cause is tried shall cause an issue to be made up between the 
parties forthwith, in which the defendant in the original action
shall be plaintiff, and the plaintiff in such action defendant; and
a jury shall be empanneled at such terms, or at such subsequent
term, as the court shall appoint, to try the issue so made up, and
assess the value of said improvements; and if they find that the
plaintiff is entitled to recover any sum for or on account of such
improvements, judgment shall be rendered for such sum as they
shall so assess and award. 
SEC. 32. If the plaintiff in the original action shall elect
to pay the defendant in such action the value of such improve- 
ments, as assessed by the jury, with interest thereon from the
time of such assessment, and costs of the suit for the assessment 
of the value of such improvements, and all taxes assessed upon
said premises, and paid by said defendant or those under whom
he claims as aforesaid, with interest thereon, within three years
after the assessment of such damages, and final judgment ren-
dered thereon, the court shall, upon satisfactory proof of the
payment or the tender of the payment of the same, award an
execution; and if the said plaintiff shall not pay or offer to pay
the same within such time, he shall be deemed to have aban-
d d 
hi 1 . f ti l h . . . d 1 d
one is c aim o it e to t e premises m question, an 10 an 
all persons claiming under him shall be forever barred of a
recovery of the premises so claimed, but shall nevertheless be
liable for the costs of such suit for the assessment of such
improvements; and said defendant shall not be liable to pay for
the use or occupation of said premises during the time any part
of such sums shall remain unpaid. 
SEC. 33. In all cases where a recovery shall be made of
lands, tenements, or hereditaments, on which the party in pos-:, 
session, or those under whom he claims, holding adversely by
color, or title asserted in good faith, founded on descent or any 
· · h 11 h ad 1 bl d
wri tten mstrument, s a ave m e va ua e an permanent 
improvements, such party shall have lien on such real estate for
the value of such improvements, and the court in which any 
action may he brought to recover possession of any lands so
improved, may summon a jury to assess and ascertain tho value
of such improvements, and judgment shall thereupon be ren-
dered by said court, to be euforced as other judgment liens on
said real estate are enforced by law. · 
SEC. 34. If any person entitled to commence any action 
specified in the foregoing section shall, at the time such title 
shall first descend or accrue, be within the age of twenty-one
years, a married woman, insane, imprisoned, or absent from the

years next after the removal of such disability, but not afterward. 

SEC. 1. All persons holding lands as joint tenants, or
tenants in coparceny or common, may have partition thereof, 
in the manner provided in this chapter.
SEC. 2. Any one or more of the persons so holding lands 
may institute an action in the circuit court for the county in
which·the lands or any portion theteof lie, by complaint, for a divis­
ion and partition thereof' according to the respective rights of the
parties interested therein, and for a sale of such premises, if it
shall appear that the partition thereof cannot be made without
great prejudice to the owners : provided, that when action is
thus instituted, if the plaintiff's complaint does not ask for a division and partition, or sale, of all the lands so owned by the
parties to the complaint, either of the parties thereto may cause
said complaint to be so amended as to include all the lands thus
owned : provided, also, that when there shall be no appearance
on the part of the defendant or defendants to the action, the
plaintiff shall pay the costs of suit and partition, unless his com­ 
plaint asks for a division and partition, or sale, of all the lands
owned by said parties as in the first section of this chapter men­
tioned, or unless the said defendant or defendants shall have 
been served with personal notice.
SEC. 3. Such action may be maintained by any person 
who has an estate in possession in the lands of which partition
is sought, but not by one who has only an estate therein in 
remainder or reversion.
SEC. 4. The complaint for a. partition or sale of any such 
lands sh~l be verified by o~t~1, and shall particularly des~ribe
the premises sought to be divided, and shall set forth' the rights 
and titles of all persons interested therein, so far as the same
are known to the plaintiff, including the interest of any tenant.
for years, for life, by the curtesy, or in dower, and the persons
entitled to the reversion, remainder, or inheritance after the
termination of any particular estate therein, and every person
who, by any contingency contained in any devise, grant, or oth­
erwise, may be or become entitled to any beneficial interest in
the premises. 
SEC. 5. Every person having any such interest as afore­
said, whether in possession or otherwise, and every perrmn enti­ 
tled to dower in such premises, if the same. has not been admeas­
ured, may be made a party to such action. 
SEC. 6. In case any one or ~ore of such parties, or the
share or quantity of interest of any of the parties be unknown 
,  
to the plaintiff, or be uncertain or contingent, or the ownership
of the inheritance shall depend upon an executory devise, or
the remainder shall be a contingent remainder, so that such
parties cannot· be named, the same shall be set forth in the com­
plaiu t. 
SEC. 7. It shall not be necessary in the first instance to 
make any creditor having a lien on the premises in question, or
any part thereof, by judg~ent, mortgage, or otherwise, a party 
to the proceedings, nor shall the partition of the premises alter,
affect, or _impair ~he lien of any_ such creditor, except in the 
cases provided for m the next section. 
SEC. 8. When the lien is on the undivided interest or
estate of ~ny of the parties, such lien, if partition be made of 
the premises, shall thereafter be ~ charge only on the share
assigned to such party, and such share shall be first charged
with its just proportion of the costs of the proceedings in parti-
tion, in pref ere nee to any such lien. 
SEC. 9. But the plaintiffs may, at their election, make
every creditor having a specific lien on the undivided interest 
or estate of any of the parties, by mortgage or otherwise, a party
to the proceedings, and in such case the complaint shall set forth
the nature of every such lien or incumbrance. 
SEC. 10. In every action for the partition or sale of any
lands pursuant to tho provisions of this chapter, the defendants, 
or such of them as reside in this state and can be found therein,
shall be served with a summons to appear and answer the com- 
plaint, as in other cases. 
SEC. 11. If any parties having an interest in such lands
k 
if . l f th k . id f I
are un nown, or 1 mt ier o e nown parties rest e out o t ie 
state or cannot ho found therein, and such facts be made to
appear to the court by affidavit, an order may be made by the
court or the judge thereof, containing a sufficient description
of the premises whereof partition is sought, and requiring all
parties interested to appear and answer the complaint, by a day
in such order to be specified, which order shall be served per-
sonally, or shall be published once in each week successively in 
such paper as may be designated in such order, and for such
time as the court shall designate, not exceeding three months. 
SEC. 12. The proof of personal service, or of the pnbli-
cation of such order, shall authorize the court to proceed to final 
. d . 11 1 k . d
JU gment against a sue 1 un nown parties, an persons not 
resident in this state or not found therein, as shall not appear
and answer by the day mentioned in the order, or on such fur-
ther day as the court may appoint, in the same manner as pro-
vided in other cases of failure to answer tho complaint; and' all
such unknown parties as may appear shall be entitled to be made
parties to the action, and the complaint may be amended accord- 
ingly. . 
SEC. 13. The general guardians residing in this state, of
all minors and other persons under guardianship, who should 
he parties to such proceedings for partition, upon giving bond
as hereinafter directed, shall represent their respective wards
therein, whether such wards shall reside in or out of this state;
and the court shall appoint guardians for all such minors who shall
he interested in the premises as have no general guardians in
this state, for the special purpose of taking charge of the inter-
ests of such minors in relation to the proceedings ; and the acts
of all such guardians of minors or others under guardianship,
shall be binding on their respective wards, and shall be as valid
as if done by them respectively when of full age or under no
legal incapacity. 
SEC. 14. Every such guardian shall give bond to the 
people of this state, to be filed with the clerk of the court, in 
such penalty and with such surety as the court shall direct, con-
ditioned for the faithful performance of the trust reposed in 
such guardian, and to render a just and true account of his
guardianship in all courts and places, when thereunto required,
and for the observance of the orders of the court in relation to
said trust. 
SEC. 15. When a complaint shall be filed for the partition
or sale of any lands, in pursuance of this chapter, and any of 
I d f d 1 · · 1 d d
t ie e en ants t ierem are minors or ot ter persons un er guar - 
ianship, and the general guardian, or person appointed guard-
ian by the court, shall fail to give the security hereinbefore
required, it shall be the duty of the court, on the application
of the plaintiffs, to appoint the clerk of said court the guardian
of such minors or other persons, for the purpose of such parti­
tion, and to dispense with the securities hereinbefore required. 
SEC. 16. Any defendant may deny the joint tenancy or
tenancv in common of any co-defendant, and any issue of fact 
J 
between the parties may be tried by a jury, as in the other cases. 
SEC. 17. Either before or after the trial of such issue, the
court may permit the complaint and all subsequent proceedings 
to be amended so as to represent truly the rights claimed by
any party, or so as to make any person a defendant who shall
have appeared in the course of the proceedings to be interested
in the premises, and who might originally have been made a
defendant if his interest had then existed or been known; but
no person shall be so made a defendant, unless by his consent,
without twenty days' notice of the motion to this effect being
personally served on him, or published once in each week suc­
cessively for one month, in such paper as the court may direct. 
SEC. 18. After any such amendment, any party whose
rights are affected thereby, and who has not had an opportunity
to sustain his claim, shall have the right to answer the complaint, 
or to put in a. further answer thereto, and to maintain his claim,
as the circumstances of the case may render proper. 
SEC. 19. In case any of the defendants, whether known
or unknown, shall fail to answer the complaint, the court shall 
take proof of the title of the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs shall
exhibit before such court proof of their title, and an abstract 
of the conveyance by which the same is held. 
SEC. 20. Upon the hearing of the cause the court shall
ascertain from the proofs so taken, in case of failure to answer the 
complaint, or from the complaint and answer, or pleadings and
proofs, if the defendants appear and answer, and shall declare, the 
rights, titles, and interests of the parties to such proceedings,
plaintiffs as well as defendants, so far as the same shall have 
appeared, and shall determine the rights of the said parties in
such lands, and shall render judgment that partition be made
between such of them as shall have any right therein, according
to such rights. 
SEC. 21. If upon the hearing of the cause, the part or
interest of any parties who shall not have appeared and answered 
the complaint, whether known or unknown, in and to such prem­
ises, shall not ham appeared by the proofs in the cause, then tho 
court shall adjudge that partition be made so far as the rights or
interests of the parties who are known, and who have appeared
in the cause, have been ascertained, and tho residue of the prem-
ises shall remain for the parties whose interests have not been
asccrtaiued, subject to division between them at any future time. 
SEC. 22. Upon rendering judgment for partition as pro-
vidcd in t~e two last preceding se~tion~, a? order sl~all ~e entered 
referring it to a proper person to mquire into the situation of the
premises, and to report whether such premises, or any part of
them, are so circumstanced that a partition and division thereof
amongst the parties interested cannot be made without great
prejudice to the owners. 
SEC. 23. If upon the coming in of the report of such per-
sou, the court shall be satisfied that partition of the premises 
between the parties interested therein can be made without
prejudice to the owners, such court shall, by an order to be 
entered in its minutes, appoint three discreet and disinterested
freeholders, commissioners to make tho partition so adjudged
according to the respective rights and interests of the parties, as
the same were ascertained and determined by. such court, and in
such order the court· shall designate the part or shares, if any,
which shall remain undivided for the owners whose interests
shall be unknown or ascertained. ' 
SEC. 24. If the persons so appointed commissioners, or
either of them, shall die, resign, or neglect to serve, the court
may, from time to time, appoint others in their places. 
SEC. 25. The commissioners, before proceeding to the
execution of their duties, shall severally be sworn, before any 
officer authorized to administer oaths, honestly and impartially
to execute the trust reposed in them, and to make partition as
directed by the court, which oath shall be filed with the clerk of
the court, on or before the coming in of the report of such com­
missioners. 
SEC. 26. In making partition, the commissioners shall
divide the said real estate and allot the several portions and 
shares thereof to the respective parties, quality and quantity
relatively considered, according to the respective rights and
interests of the parties so adjudged by the court, designating the
several shares and portions by posts, ssones, or other permanent
monuments; and they may, if necessary, employ a surveyor, with
the necessary assistants, to aid them therein. 
SEC. 27. The commissioners· shall make an ample report
of their proceedings, under the hands of any two of them, specify- 
ing therein the manner of executing their trust, and describing
the land divided, and the shares allotted to each party, with con-
venient certainty, and the items of their charges. 
SEC. 28. All the commissioners must meet together in
the performance of any of. their duties, but the acts of a majority
so met shall be valid. 
SEC. 29. The expenses of the commissioners, including
the expenses of a. surveyor and his assistants, when they shall be
employed, shall be ascertained and allowed by the court, and the
amount thereof, together with such compensation as shall be
allowed to the commissioners. by the court for their services, shall 
plaintiffs, and shall be allowed to them as part of
the costs to be taxed. 
SEC. 30. On good cause shown, the court may set aside
the report, and commit the case to the same, or appoint new
commissioners, as often as may be necessary, who shall proceed
in like manner as hereinbefore directed. 
SEC. 81. Upon the confirmation of the report of any com-
missioners by the court, judgment shall thereupon be entered
that such partition be firm and effectual forever, and such judg­
ment shall be binding and conclusive- 
1. On all parties named therein, and their legal representa­
tives, who shall at the time have any interest in the premises
divided, as owners in fee, or as tenants for years, or as entitled
to the reversion, remainder, or inheritance of such premises,
after the termination of any particular estate therein; or who,
by any contingency contained in any will or grant, or otherwise,
may be or become entitled to any beneficial interest in the prem­
ises; or who shall have any interest in any undivided share of the
premisesvas tenant for years, for life, by the curtesy, or in dower. 
2. On all persons interested in the premises who may be
unknown, to whom notice shall have been given by personal
service or by publishing the same as is herein before directed; 
and- 
3. On all other persons claiming from such parties or persons,
or either of them. 
SEC. 32. But such judgment and partition shall not affect
any tenants, or persons having claims as tenants in dower, by the 
curtesy, or for life, to the whole of the premises which shall be
the subject of ·such partition, nor shall any such judgment and 
partition preclude any person, except such as are specified in the
last preceding section, from claiming any title to the premises in
question, or from controverting the title or interest of the parties
between whom such partition shall be made. 
SEC. 33. If the person to whom reference shall be made
as herein before provided, shall report to the court that the lands 
or tenements of which division and partition is sought, are so
situated, or that any distinct tract, lot, or portion thereof, is so
situated, that a partition and division thereof amongst the persons
interested therein cannot be made without great prejudice to the
owners, and if the court shall be satisfied that such report is just
and correct, the court may thereupon make an order that the
sheriff sell the premises so situated, at public auction, to the
highest bidder. 
SEC. 84. The court shall direct in such order the terms
of credit which may be allowed for any portions of the purchase 
money of which it shall think proper to direct the investment,
and for such portions of such purchase money as are required by
the provisions hereinafter contained to be invested for the benefit
of any unknown owners, any infants, any parties out of the state,
or any tenants for life, in dower, or by the curtesy, 
SEC. 35. The portions of the purchase money for which
credit shall be allowed, shall always be secured at interest by a
mortgage of the premises sold, by the bond of the purchaser,
and by such other security as the court shall prescribe. 
SEC. 86. The sheriff may take separate mortgages and
other securities for such convenient shares or portions or the 
purchase money as are directed by the court to be invested, in
the name of tho clerk of the court in whose office the origi- 
nal bill for a partition was filed, and his successors in office, and
for such shares as any known owner of full age shall desire to 
have so invested, in tho name of such owner. 
SEC. 37. Upon such sales being confirmed as hereinafter
mentioned, the said sheriff shall deliver such mortgages and 
other securities, to the tlerk of the court, or to tho known
owners whose shares were so invested. 
SEC. 88. Before making any order for the sale of the
said premises, where the creditors having specific liens shall not
have been made parties, the court shall direct the plaintiff to
amend his complaint by making every creditor having o. 'specific 
tien on the undivided interest or estate of any of the parties, by
mortgage or otherwise, a party to the proceedings. 
SEC. 89. If it shall appear by the proceedings in such
complaint, or by such report, that there are any existing in cum- 
brances upon the estate or interest in the premises of any
party named in the proceedings in the suit, the court shall, in
the order· of sale, direct. the sheriff to bring into court, and pay
to the clerk, the portion of moneys arising from the· sale c,f the
estate and interest of such party, after deducting the portion of
the costs, charges, and expensesto which it shall be Iiable.: 
SEC. 40. Such party may apply to the court to order such
moneys, or such part 'thereof as he shall claim, to be paid to 
him ; which application shall be accompanied-
1. By his own affidavit,- stating the true amount actually due 
on each incumbrance, the owner or such incumbrance, and his
residence, as far as known to such party. 
2. By proof, by affidavit, of the due service of a notice on
each owner of any incumbrance, of the intention to make such
application, o.t least fourteen days previously. IC such owner
reside in this state, such notice shall be served personally, or if
be be absent from his residence, by leaving a. copy there, with
some person of his household of proper age. If such owner
reside out of this state, such notice may be served on hitn per­
sonally, thirty days previously, or by publishing the same in
such paper as the court may direct, three weeks successively,
once m each week. · 
SEC. 41. Upon such application and proof of notice, the
court shall proceed to hear the proofs and allegations of the 
parties ; and if any question of fact shall ··arise, which in' the
opinion of the co.irt cannot be satisfactorily determined without
a trial by jury, the court shall direct an issue to be made, which
8hall be tried as in other cases, and the costs of such trial shall
be paid by the party failing, which payment shall be enforced
by attachment as in other cases. 
SEC. 42. When the amount or existing incumbrances 
sl1all have been · ascertained, the court shall · proceed to order a
distribution of the moneys so brought into and remaining in 
court, among the several creditors having such Incumbrances,
according to the priority thereof respectively. 
SEC. 43. The clerk of the court by whom any such
incumbrance shall be paid off shall procure satisfaction thereof, 
to be acknowledged in the form required by law, shall cause
such incumbrance to be duly satisfied or canceled of record, 
and shall defray the expenses thereof out of the portion of
the moneys in court belonging to the party by whom such 
incumbrance was payable. 
SEC. 44. The proceedings to ascertain and settle the
amount of incumbrances as herein provided shall not affect any
other party in such suit for partition, nor delay the paying over
or investing the moneys to or for the benefit of any party upon
whose estate in the premises there shall not appear to be any
existing i,nCumbrances. 
SEC. 45. Whenever the estate of any tenant in dower,
or by curtesy, or for life, in jhe whole or any part or share of 
the premises in question, has been admitted by the parties, or
ascertained by the court, to be existing at the time of the order
for such sale, and the person entitled to such estate has been
made a party to the proceedings, the court shall first consider
and determine under all the circumstances of the case, whether
such estate ought to be excepted from such sale, or whether the
same should be sold, and in making such determination, regard
shall be had to the interests of all parties. 
SEC. 46. If a sale of the premises including such estate
shall be ordered, the estate and interest of every such tenant or
person shall pass thereby, and the purchaser, his heirs and
assigns, shall hold such premises free and discharged from all
claims by virtue of any such estate or interest, whether the
same be to any undivided share of a joint tenant, or tenant in
common, or to the whole or any part of the premises sold. 
SEC. 47. Upon such sale being ma.de of any such interest
or estate, the court shall direct the payment of such sum in 
d l f. h l d
gross, out of the procee st iereo , tot e person entit e to such 
estate in dower, tenancy by the curtesy, or tenancy for life, as
shall be deemed, upon the principles of law applicable to annui­ 
ties, a reasonable · satisfaction for such estate or interest, and
which the person so entitled shall consent to accept in lieu
thereof, by an instrument under seal, duly acknowiedged or
proved in the manner that deeds are required to be acknowl­
edged or proved to entitle them to be recorded. 
SEC. 48. In case no such consent is given at or before
the coming in of the report of sale by the sheriff, then the court 
shall ascertain and determine what proportion of the proceeds of
such sale, after deducting all expenses, will be a just and rea­
sonable sum to be invested for the benefit of ~e person entitled
to such estate or interest in dower, by the curtesy, or for life, and
shall order the same to be brought into court for that purpose. 
SEC. 49. The proportions of the proceeds of such sale to
be invested shall be ascertained and determined in the several 
eases as follows :-
1. If an estate in dower shall have been included in such 
order of sale, its proportions shall be one-third of the proceeds
of the sale of the premises, or of the sale of the undivided 
share in such premises, upon which such claim of dower existed. 
2. If an estate by the curtesy, or other estate for life, shall be
inciuded in the order of sale, its proportion shall be the whole
proceeds of the sale of the premises, or of the sale of the undi-
vided share thereof, in which such estate shall be. 
And in all cases the proportion of the expenses of the pro­
ceedings shall be deducted from the proceeds of such sale. 
SEC. 50. If the persons entitled to any such estate in
dower, by the curtesy, or for life, be unknown, the court shall
take order for the protection of the rights of such persons, in
the same manner, as far as may be, as if they were known and
had appeared. 
SEC. 51. The sheriff shall give notice of any sale to be
made by him, for the same time and in the same manner as is 
required by law on sales of real estate by sheriffs on execution.
SEC. 52. The terms of such sale shall be made known at 
the time, and if the premises consist of distinct lots, tracts, or
parcels, they shall be sold separately. 
SEC. 53. No such sheriff, nor any person for his benefit,
shall be interested in the purchase, nor directly or indirectly
purchase any of the premises sold ; nor shall any guardian of
any infant party in such action purchase, or be interested in the
purchase of, any lands being the subject of such action, except
for the benefit or in behalf of such infant; and all sales con-
trary to the provisions of this section shall be void. 
SEC. 54. After completing such sale, the sheriff shall
report the same to the court, with a description of the different
parcels of land sold to each purchaser, the name of such pur-
chaser, and the price bid by him, which report shall be filed in 
the court. 
SEC. 55. If such sales be approved and confirmed by the 
court, an order shall be entered directing the sheriff to execute
conveyances pursuant to such sales, which such sheriff shall be
authorized to do upon the entry of such order.

in the county where the premises are situated, and shall be a bar 
against all persons interested in any way, who shall have been
named as parties in the said proceedings, and against all such 
parties as were unknown, if notice of the order to appear and
answer shall have been given by such publication or service of
notice as is hereinbefore directed, and against all other persons
claiming from such parties or either of them. 
SEC. 57. Such conveyance shall also be a bar against all
persons having specific liens. on any undivided share or interest 
therein, who shall have been made parties to the proceedings
but no creditor having any such specific lien shall be affected by
such sale or conveyance, unless he shall have been made a. party
to the proceedings. 
SEC. 58. The costs and expenses of the proceedings shall
be deducted from the proceeds of every sale made by the sheriff;
and shall be by him, in the first instance, paid to the plaintiffs
or their attorney.

costs, shall be divided among the parties whose rights and inter-
ests shall have been sold, in proportion to their respective rights 
in the premises; and the shares of such of the said parties as are
of full age shall be paid to them or their legal representatives by 
the sheriff, or shall be brought into court for their use. 
SEC. 60. When any of such known parties are infants, the
court may,· in its discretion, direct the shares of such infants to 
be paid over to the general· guardian, or to be invested in per­
manent securities, at interest, in the· name and for the benefit 
of such infant. 
SEC. 61. Where e.ny of the parties whose interests have
been sold are -absent from 'the state, without· legal representa­

same to be invested in permanent securities, at interest, so that
such interest shall annually be paid to the parties entitled to
such estate; dnring their lives, respectively. · 
SEC. 63. The court may, in its· discretion, require all or
any of· the parties, before they shall receive any share of the 
moneys arising from such gales, to give security to the satisfac­
tion of such court, to refund the said share, with interest thereon, 
··in case it shall thereafter appear that such party was not entitled
thereto. 
SEC. 64. When any 'secu'rity is directed to be taken by

account in writing, and on oath, of all moneys received by him
and of the application thereof.

the ·existing clerk, and no -action 'shall be abated by the death,
removal from office, or resignation of the c1erk to whom such
securities or evidences were executed, orof any ot his successors. 
SEC. 68. When a judgment confirming tho partition

concerned therein, other than the plaintiffs, pay to such plain- 
tiffs a proportion of the costs and charges of the proceedings, to
be ascertained by the court according to the respective rights of
the parties, and the proportion of such costs and charges
assessed upon the unknown' owners, to be chargeable on the
part remaining undivided ; and upon such judgment execution
may issue as in other cases, and may be levied on the property
of the parties respectively charged with such costs, arid upon any
share or part of the premises allotted on any such division to
any owner unknown or not named, and upon every portion
remaining undivided, for the proportion adjudged to be paid by
such-owners, or chargeable to the part rcma.ining undivided.

of such infant to agree to a division thereof, or to a sale of such
premises, or of such part thereof as in the opinion of the court
shall be capable of partition, or as shall be most for the interest
of such infant to be sold.

the partition or sale so made by him, a. nd if the same be ap- 
d

joint tenants, or tenants in common. 
SEC. 78. Such releases shall be as valid and effectual to

when of sound mind and understanding, and not subject to
guardianship, and for a valuable consideration. 
SEC. 79. When any lands shall be held by the state and by
individuals, as tenants in common, proceedings for the partition

escence of any party having any such claim.

circuit court, if _it sh~ll appeai: t~at it cann?t bo ma~e equal 
between the parties without prejudice to the rights and interests

CHAPTER CXLV. 
OF ACTIONS FOR THE FORECLOS'CRE OF A MORTGAGE. 
SEC. 1. In actions for the foreclosure or satisfaction of a
mortgage, if the plaintiff recover, the court shall order a sale of 
the mortgaged premises, or such part thereof as may be sufficient
to discharge the amount due on the mortgage, with costs. 
SEC. 2. The proceeds of every sale made under such
order shall be applied to the discharge of the debt adjudged by 
such court to be due, and of the costs awarded; and if there
shall be any surplus, it shall be brought into court for the use of 
the defendant, or of the person who may be entitled thereto,
subject to the order of the court. 
SEC. 3. If such surplus or part thereof shall remain in
the said court for the term of three months, without being 
applied for, the judge shall direct the same to be put out at
interest, under the direction of the court, for the benefit of the
defendant, his representatives or assigns, to be paid to them by
the order of such court. 
SEC. 4. Whenever an action shall be commenced for the
satisfaction or foreclosure of any mortgage, upon which there 
shall be due any interest, or any portion or installment of the
principal, and there shall be other portions or installments to 
become clue subsequently, the action shall be dismissed upon the
defendant's bringing into court, at any time before the order of
sale, the principal and interest due, with costs. 
SEC. 5. If after an order for sale entered against a. 
defendant in such case, he shall bring into court the principal
and interest due, with the costs, the proceedings in tho action
shall be stayed ; but the court shall enter a judgment of fore-· 
closure and sale, to be enforced by a further order of the court
upon a subsequent default in the payment of any portion or
installment of the principal, or of any interest, thereafter to
grow due. 
SEC. 6. If the defendant shall not bring into court the
amount due, with costs, or .if .for any other cause . a judgm?nt 
shall be entered for the plam tiff, the court shall direct a refer­
ence to a proper officer to ascertain and report the situation of 
the mortgaged premises; and if it shall appear that the same can
be sold in parcels without injury to the interests of the parties,
the judgment shall direct so much of the said premises to be
sold as will be sufficient to pay the amount then due on such
mortgage, with costs, and such judgment shall 'remain as
security for any subsequcne default. 
SEC. 7. If in the-tease mentioned in the preceding section
there shall be any default subsequent to such judgment, in the
payment of any portion or installment of the principal, or of any
interest due upon such mortgage, the court may, upon petition
of the complainant, by a further order, founded upon such first
judgment, direct a sale of so much of the mortgaged premises, 
to be made under the said judgment, as will be sufficient to
satisfy the amount so due, with the costs of such petition and 
the subsequent proceedings thereon; and the same proceedings
shall be had as often as a default shall happen. · 
SEC. 8. If, in any of the foregoing cases, it shalf appear to
the court that the mortgaged premises are so situated that the 
sale of the whole will be most beneficial to the parties, the
court shall order and adjudge the sale of the whole accordingly. 
SEC. 9. In such case the proceeds of such sale shall be
applied as well to the interest, portion or installment of the
princi pal due, as toward the whole or residue of the same, 
secured by such mortgage, and not due and payable at the time
of such sale ; and if such residue do not bear interest, then the
court may direct the same to be paid, with a deduction of the
rate of legal interest for the time during which such residue
shall not be due and payable, or may direct the balance of the
proceeds of such sale, after paying the sum due, with costs, to
be put out at interest for the benefit of the plaintiff, to be paid
to him as the installments, or portions of the principal, or the
interest, may become due, and the surplus for the benefit of the
defendant, his representatives or assigns, to be paid to them on
the order of the court. 

SEC. 1. That in all suits hereafter brought, or iii all com
plaints hereafter filed, or in suits or complaints now pending in 
any o t ie courts o t us state, in avor o in 1v1 ua s, or rai roa
or other companies, or their assigns, to enforce the collection of 
any note or notes, or to foreclose mortgages given to secure the
payment thereof, the maker of any such note or notes, or mort-
gagor, may set up by plea or answer in his or her defense, that
the note or notes or mortgage sued or complained on, was 
· obtained by fraud or false representations; and if upon the trial
or hearing, the said defense should be sustained by the proofs,
then the verdict of the jury or decision of the court shall be for
the defendant or defendants, and he, her, or they shall have

that purpose.
SEC. 15. ' Whenever any action for the recovery of any 
lands pr tenements, or for the recovery of the possession thereof,

come, shall be liable to an action for such damages for the time
that he shall have possessed the premises.

possession of real property shall he issued upon a judgment in
any action relating to real property, the plaintiff may include in 
the same process, an execution against the property of the
defendant to collect the costs or damages which 'may be due, in 
the same cases in which he would be authorized to issue such
execution separately.

shall be the same in all respects as in personal actions, except
where otherwise specially provided by law, and all the provisions

recover the Value Of all the assets received by all the defendants
in the action, if necessary to satisfy his demand ; and the amount 
of the recovery shall be apportioned among the defendants, in
proportion to the value of the assets received by each; and no
allowance or deduction shall be made from such amount on
account of thero being other relatives to whom assets have also
been delivered. 
SEC. 27. Any of the next of kin, against whom a recov-
ery shall be had, pursuant to the preceding sections, may main-

any such assets may have been paid, jointly, or against any of 
them separately, for a just and equal contribution; and shall be
entitled to recover of each defendant, such an amount as shall be

tiff, as the value of the assets delivered to such defendant bore to
the value of all the assets delivered to all the relatives of the
deceased. 
SEC. 28. Actions by creditors of any deceased persons to 
recover the value of any assets that may have been paid by any
executor or administrator, to any legatees of their testator, may

2. That the value of such assets have been recovered by some
other creditor; or-

ciency.

several legacies, and such proportion only shall be recovered of 
each legatee. 
SEC. 31. If any action be brought against several relatives
jointly, or against several legatees jointly, for assets delivered to 
them, if a recovery be had against them, the costs of such action
shall be apportioned to the several defendants in proportion to 
the amount of the debt or damages recovered against each of
them. 
SEC. 32. In every such action the judgment shall express
the amount recovered against each defendant for debt or dam- 
ages and costs, and the execution thereon shall correspond to
such judgment. 
SEC. 33. In case of any judgment against several relatives
o a testator, or against several legatees, the payment or satis ac-
tion of the amount reserved against any one of the defendants 
shall discharge such defendant, and shall exonerate him and his
property from judgment, and from tho execution thereon. 
SEC. 34. The heirs of every person who shall have died
intestate, and the heirs and devisees of any person who shall 
have died after the making of his last will and testament, shall
respectively be liable for the debts of such person, arising by
simple contract or by specialty, to the extent of the estate, 
interest, and right in the real estate which shall have descended
to them from or been devised to them by such person. 
SEC. 35. But such heirs shall not be liable for any such
debt unless it shall appear that the personal assets of the deceased
were not sufficient to pay and discharge the same, or that after
due proceedings before the proper county court, and at law, the
creditor has been unable to collect such debt, or some part
thereof, from the personal representatives of the deceased, or
from his next of kin or legatees. 
SEC. 36. In case the personal assets were sufficient to pay
a part of such debts, or in case a part thereof shall have been 
collected, as in the last section mentioned, the heirs of such
deceased person shall be liable· for the residue unpaid or
unsettled. 
SEC. 37. But the two last sections shall not affect or
impair the liability of heirs for any debt of their ancestor, where
such debt was by his will expressly charged exclusively upon the
real estate descended to such heirs, or where such debt is by such
will expressly directed to be paid out of the real estate descended,
before resorting to the personal estate. 
SEC. 38. It shall be incumbent on the creditors seeking
to charge any heirs, to show the fact and circumstances herein 
required to render them liable.· 
SEC. 39. In cases where the next of kin, heirs, and devi-
socs are liable for the debts of their ancestors, as herein provided, 
they shall give preference in the payment of the same, and shall

unliquidated demands and accounts. 
SEC. 40. No preference shall be given by any next of kin,
legatee, heir, or devisee, to any debt, over other debts of the same
class, except those specified in. the second class of the last section;
nor shall a debt due and payable, be entitled to a preference over
debts not due ; nor shall the commencement of an action against
any next of kin, legatee, heir, or devisee, for the recovery of any
debt, entitle such debt to any preference over others of the same
class. 
SEC. 41. The next of kin, legatee, heirs, and devisees may
show that there are debts of a prior class unsatisfied, or that there 
are unpaid debts of the same class with that on which the action
is brought, and if it appear that the value of the personal property
delivered to them, or of the real estate descended or devised to
them, does not exceed the debts of a prior class, judgment shall
be rendered in their favor. 
SEC. 42. If the personal property delivered to such next
of kin, or legatee, or if the real estate descended or devised to 
sue ieirs an evisees, excee t e amount o e ts w ic 1 are
entitled to a preference over the debt for which the action is
brought, judgment shall be rendered against them only for such
a sum as shall be a just proportion to the other debts of the same
class with that on which the action is brought. 
SEC. 43. If any debt of a prior class to that on which the
action is brought, or of the same class, shall have been paid by 
any next of kin, legatees, heirs, or dcvisees, they may give evidence
of such payment, and the amount of debts so paid shall be esti-
mated in ascertaining the amount to be recovered, in the same
manner as if such debts were outstanding and unpaid, as pre-
scribed in the two last sections. 
SEC. 44. The heirs of any person who may be liable to 
any creditor of such person,. in consequence of lands having
descended to them, shall be prosecuted jointly, in the circuit court. 
SEC. 45. Actions against heirs or devisees shall not be
delayed, nor shall the remedy of the plaintiffs be suspended, by 
reason of the infancy of any such heir or devisee ; but guardians
to defend their rights in such actions shall be appointed as in 
other cases.

them on account of any lands and tenements, or hereditaments,

une o t e commencemen t iereo , e ia not mg y cscent,
or that he had not sufficient to ~atisfy the plaintiff's demand. 
SEC. 48. If it appear that the lands or tenements have
descended to such heir, the court shall inquire and ascertain the
value .thereo~, either by reference to a proper officer, or by 
awarding 'an issue for that purpose. 
SEC. 49. If it appear that the lands, tenements, or here-
ditaments so descended, were not aliened· by such heir, at the time 
of the commencement of the action, or if the heir confess the
action, and show what lands, tenements, or hereditaments have
descended to him, the court shall adjudge that the debt of the
plaintiff, or the proportion thereof which he is entitled to recover,
shall be levied of such real estate so descended, and not otherwise. 
SEC. 50. Every final judgment rendered in such action,
shall have preference as a lien on the real estate descended, to 
 d d b . d . h h . 11
any JU gment or ecree o tame against sue err persona y, 
for any debt or demand in his own right.
SEC. 51. When it shall appear in any such action that 
before the commencement thereof, any such heir has aliened the
lands, tenements, or hereditaments descended to him, or any 
part thereof, he shall be personally liable for the value of the
estate so aliened; and judgment shall be rendered therefor, and
execution awarded, as in actions for his own debt. 
SEC. 52. In such cases the preference hereinbeforc
d 1 d ' d d ' h f h h '

shall apply, and such heir may show the same matters hereinbeforc 
allowed, and the same proceedings and judgment shall be had
thereon. 
SEC. 53. But no lands, tenements, or hereditaments
aliened in good faith, by any heir, before any action commenced
against him, shall be liable to execution, or in any manner 
affected by a decree against such heir. 
SEC. 54. In actions brought against several heirs jointly,
Or several devisees jointly, the amount Which the plaintiff Shall 
be entitled to recover shall be apportioned among the heirs of
the ancestor, or among all the devisees of the testator, in pro­
portion to the value of the real estate descended to such heirs,
or devised to such devisees, respectively, as the case may be ; 
and such proportion only shall be recovered of each heir or of
each legatee. 

SEC. 56. When a judgment shall be rendered against
any heirs or dovisees who are infants, no execution issued 
thereon shall be executed against them, until the expiration of 
one year after the rendition of such judgment; but such execu­ 
tion may be executed against any defendants in the same action
who are of full age. 
SEC. 57. The attorney issuing an execution in every such
case shall indorse thereon the names of the defendants who are 
' c. d h ll di I h 'ff h
infants, an s a irect t 10 s en not to execute t e same 
against such infants until the time specified in the last section. 
SEC. 58. Devisees made liable by the foregoing provisions
to the creditors of their testator, shall not be so liable unless it 
shall appear that his personal assets, o.nd the real estate of the
testator, descended to his heirs, were insufficient to discharge 
such debt ; or unless it shall appear that after due proceedings,
before the proper county judge, and at law, the creditor has been
unable to recover such debt, or some part thereof, from the
personal representatives of the testator, or from hiA next of kin,
or legatees, or from his heirs. 
SEC. 59. In either of the cases specified in the last section,
the amount of the deficiency of the personal assets, and of the
real estate descended, to satisfy the debt of the plaintiff, and the 
amount which such plaintiff may have failed to recover from the
personal representatives of the testator, his next of kin, legatees,
and heirs, may be recovered of the devisees of such testator, to
the extent of the real estate devised to them respectively. 
SEC. 60. But the two last sections shall not impair or
affect the liability of devisees for any debt of their testator,
where such debt was by his will expressly charged exclusively
upon the real estate devised, or made payable exclusively by
such devisee by the terms of the will, or made payable out of
the estate devised, before resorting to the personal estate, or to
any other real estate, descended or devised. 
SEC. 61. It shall be incumbent on the creditor seeking to
charge any devisees, to show on the trial the facts and circum- 
stances herein required to render them liable.
SEC. 62. The provisions herein contained, with regard to 
heirs, and to proceedings by and against them, shall be applicable
to actions and proceedings against devisees, who shall in like
manner be sued jointly. 
SEC. 63. Devisees shall be liable in the same manner,
and to the same extent, as heirs, notwithstanding they may have 
a iene t ie re estate evise erore action roug t against
them ; but no real estate aliened in good faith by any devisee,
before the commencement of an action against him, shall be
liable to execution upon or in any manner affected by a. judg-
ment against such devisee. 

SEC. 64. In cases where, by the provisions of any statute,
a child born after the making of a will shall be entitled to sue- 
ceed to a portion of the testator's real and personal estate, such
cl~ild ~hall have the same rights and rc!D:edies to compel a dis- 
tribution of the personal estate, and partition of the real estate,
as are provided by law for the next of kin, and for heirs ; and 
shall, in all respects, be liable in the same manner and to the
same extent to the creditors of his ancestor, in respect to the
personal property delivered to him, and the real estate descended
to him, as are herein prescribed in relation to next of kin and
heirs. 
SEC. 65. Such child shall be authorized to recover of the
legatees who may have received any property or effects of the
testator, the portion of such property or effects to which he may
be entitled; and shall also be entitled to recover of the devisees 
estate, under the will of the testator, such portion
of such real estate as shall belong to him. 
SEC. 66. In cases where a distribution of such personal
estate shall not have been made by the judge of the county
court, to any such child born after the making of a will, the
court shall have power to compel the same ; and the said court
shall have power also to compel just and equal contribution by
the legatees 'under such will; to make up the portion of personal
property to which such child shall be entitled. 
SEC. 67. The c~urt shall also have power to compel par-
tition between the devisees of any real estate and such child so 
entitled to a portion of such real estate, so as to enforce a just
and proportionate contribution by each devisee. · 
SEC. 68. The foregoing provisions relative to a child born
after the making of a will shall apply equally in all respects to 
every person who, being a witness to a will, shall be entitled,
by the provisions of any statute, to recover any portion of tho 
personal or real estate of the testator from the legatees and
devisees named in such will. .

such answer. 
SEC. 4. In actions by or against any corporation created
by or under any law of this state, it shall not be necessary to

being in this state, and belonging to, or owned by, or in which
any such corporation has an interest, or which would belong to,
or would be owned by, or in which any such corporation has or
would have an interest, had the same not ceased to act as afore-
said, whether held, managed, or controlled by such corporation,
or by a trustee or trustees, assignee or assignees, agent or
agents, for the use and benefit, in whole or in part, of such cor-
poration, or the creditors thereof, or for the use and benefit of
both such corporation and creditors, however created, made,
constituted, or appointed.

recovery of any such debt, claim, or demand as aforesaid, shall, 
to the extent of the final recovery in such actions, in all cases

effects, property, and interests aforesaid, from the time an
appearance to the action shall be or has been · entered on the
part of the defendant, (which shall be such corporation in its
corporate name,) unless such corporation or some one on its
behalf shall make to such plaintiff a bond in the penal sum of
double the amount claimed to be due, executed by two or more
sureties, resident freeholders of this state, who shall swear that
they are each worth, of real estate lying in this state, and liable

property of the defendant, lying or being in this state, or in
which such corporation hasan interest, or which would belong 
to, or be owned by, or in which such corporation has or would
have an interest, had not the same ceased to act as such corpora-
tion, or so much thereof as will satisfy the plaintiff's demand,
with costs, whether held, managed, or controlled by such corpo- 
ration, or by a trustee or trustees, assignee or assignees, agent or
agents, for the use and benefit, in whole or in part, of such cor­

which have, in whole or in part, ceased to act as a body corpo-

service shall be as binding and effectual as personal service in 
actions between individuals in other cases.
SEC. 10. In actions mentioned in the last preceding section, process shall conform, as near as may be, to process in other
cases; and from the issuing of summons to final judgment and 
satisfaction, all the provisions of law shall apply to actions com-
menced or to be prosecuted under this chapter, so far as the
same are consistent with, and not repugnant thereto, and no 
further.
SEC. 11. A foreign corporation, created by or under the 
law of any other state government or country may prosecute in
the courts of this state, in the same manner as corporations
created under the law~ of ~his state, upon giving security for tho 
payment or costs of action, in the same manner that non-residents
arc required by law to do. 
SEC. 12. But where, by the laws of this state, any net is
forbidden to be done by any corporation, or by any association
of individuals, without express authority by law, and such act
shall have been done by a foreign corporation, it shall not be

upon any liability or obligation, express or implied, arising out
of, or made or entered into in consideration of, such act. 
SEC. 13. Upon a complaint being filed under the direction
of tho attorney general, in any circuit court, such court shall 
have power to restrain, by injunction, any corporation from
assuming or exercising any franchise, liberty, or privilege, or
transacting any business, not authorized by the charter of such
corporation ; and in the same manner to restrain any individu­
als from exercising any corporate rights, privileges, or franchises, 
not granted to them by any law of this state.
SEC. 14. Such injunction may be issued before the answer, 
upon satisfactory proof that the defendants complained of have
usurped, exercised, or claimed any franchise, privilege, liberty, 
or corporate right, not granted to them; and after the answer,
such "injunction may be continued until judgment shall have 
been rendered.
SEC. 15. The circuit court shall have jurisdiction over 
directors, managers, trustees, and other officers of corporations:­
1 .. To compel them to account for their official conduct in the 
management and disposition of the funds and property commit­
ted to their charge. 
2. To order and compel payment by them to the corporation
whom they represent, and to its creditors, of all sums of money, 
and of the value of all property which they may have acquired 
to themselves, or transferred to others, or may have lost or
wasted by any violation of their duties as such directors, mana-
gers, trustees, or other officers.

cising his office, whenever it shall appear that he has abused his
trust.

alienation knew the purpose for which the 'same was made ; 
and-
8. To restrain and prevent any such alienation in cases where 
it may be threatened, or there may be good reason to apprehend
that it is intended to be made. 
SEC. 16. When any visitorial powers over any corporation
are or shall be vested by statute in any corporate body or public 
officer, the provisions of the preceding section shall not be con-
strued to divest or impair the powers so vested. 
SEC. 17. The jurisdiction conferred by the fourteenth [fif-
tee nth] section of this chapter shall be exercised as in ordinary 
cases, on complaint or petition, as the case may require, or as the
court may direct, at the instance of the attorney general prose-
cuting in behalf of this state, or at the instance of any creditor
of such corporation, or at the instance of any director, trustee,
or other officer of such corporation, having a general superin- 
tendence of its concerns. 
SEC. 18. Whenever a judgment shall be obtained against
any corporation incorporated under the laws of this state, and 
an execution issued thereon shall have been returned unsatis-
fled, in whole or in part, upon the petition of the person obtain- 
ing such judgment, or his representatives, the circuit court
within the proper county may sequestrate the stock, property,
things in action, and effects of such corporation, and may appoint
a receiver of the same. 
SEC. 19. In the final order on any such petition, the court
shall direct a just and fair distribution of the property.of such
corporation, and of the proceeds thereof, to be made among the 
fair and honest creditors of such corporation, in proportion to
their debts respectively, who shall be paid in the same order as 
provided in the case of a voluntary dissolution or a corporation. 
SEC. 20. Whenever any incorporated company shall have
remained insolvent for one whole year, or for one year shall have
neglected or refused to pay and discharge its notes or other evi-
dences of debts, or for one year shall have suspended the ordi- 
nary and lawful business of such corporation, it shall be deemed
to have surrendered the rights, privileges, and franchises granted
by any act of incorporation, or acquired under the laws of this
state, and shall be adjudged to be dissolved. 
SEC. 21. Whenever any corporation having banking pow­
ers, or1 h~vindgbth1e power tokm.ake loans, o1r p11Icbdges, o~ dep1osits,

any of the provisions of its act or acts of incorporation, or of
any other law binding on such corporation,-any court having
jurisdiction may, by injunction, restrain such corporation and 
its officers from exercising any of its corporate rights, privileges,
or franchises, and from collecting or receiving any debts or
demands, and from paying out, or in any way transferring or
delivering to any person, any of the moneys, property, or effects 
of such corporation, until such court shall otherwise order.
SEC. 22. Such injunction may be issued on the applica­ 
tion of the attorney general in behalf of this state, or on the
application of any creditor or stockholder of such corporation, 
upon complaint filed for that purpose, and upon due proof of
any of the facts in the lust section required to authorize the
issuing of the same. Whenever such injunction shall issue
against any bank, for any violation of its charter, on the appli­
cation of any creditor, the court shall proceed to final judgment
in such case, and adjudge a forfeiture, if the proof is sufficient,
notwithstanding such creditor may settle with such corporation;
and in all such cases the attorney general, under the direction
of the governor, or any creditor, shall have the right to appear
and prosecute such action ; and such action shall not be discon­
tinued, if either of them so appear and prosecute such action
to final judgment. 
SEC. 23. Upon such application being made in any stage of
the proceedings thereupon, the court may appoint one or more 
receivers to take charge of the property and effects of such cor-
poration, and to collect, sue for, and recover the debts and
demands that may be due, and the property that may belong to
such corporation, who shall in all respects be subject to the 
control of the court.
SEC. 24. Such receivers shall possess all the powers and 
authority conferred, and be subject to all the obligations and 
 d ·
duties imposed, upon receivers appomte m the case of the vol- 
untary dissolution of a corporation.
SEC. 25. If such application be made by e. creditor of 
any corporation, whose directors or stockholders arc made liable
by law for the payment o sue 1 e t, m any event or coutin-
gency, such directors or stockholders, or any of them, may be
made parties to the action, either at the commencement thereof
or in any subsequent stage of the proceedings, whenever it shall
become necessary to enforce such liability. 
SEC. 26. If any creditor of a corporation desires to make
such direct?rs or ~tockholders part~es to the action, after a Judg- 
.meut therem against the corporation, he may do so by filmg a.
~omplaint against them founded upon such judgment; and if 
such judgment was rendered in a proceeding instituted by the
attorney general, such creditor may, on his application, he made 
plaintiff therein, and may in like manner make the directors
and stockholders sought to be charged defendants in such action. 
SEC. 27. Whenever any creditor of a corporation shall
k
l
1 
di l , di
sec to c iarge t ie irectors, trustees, or ot ier superiuten mg 
officers of such corporation, or stockholders thereof, on account
of any liability created by law, he may commence an action for
that purpose in any circuit court which shall possess jurisdic-
tion to enforce such liability, 
SEC. 28. The court shall proceed therein as in other 
cases, and, when necessary, shall cause an account to be taken
of the property, and debts due to and from such corporation, 
and shall appoint one or more receivers, who shall possess all the
powers conferred, and be subject to all tho obligations imposed,
on receivers in case of the voluntary dissolution of a corporation. 
SEC. 29. But if upon the filing of the answer, or upon the
taking of any such account, it shall appear that such corporation
is insolvent, and that it has no property or effects to satisfy such 
creditor, the court may proceed, without appointing any receiver,
to ascertain the respective liabilities of such directors and stock-
holders, and enforce the same · by its judgment, as in other
cases. · 
SEC. 80. Upon a final judgment being made upon any
such application to restrain a corporation, or in any action com- 
mcnced against directors or stockholders, the court shall cause a
just and fair distribution of the property of such corporation,
and of the proceeds thereof, to be made among its fair and
honest creditors, in the order and in the proportions prescribed
in tho case of a voluntary dissolution of a corporation. 
SEC. 31. In all cases in which the directors or other offi-
cers of a corporation, or the stockholders thereof, shall have been 
made parties to an action in which judgment shall be rendered,
if the property of such corporation shall be insufficient to dis- 
charge its debts, the court shall proceed to compel each stock-
holder to pay in the amount due and remaining unpaid on the
shares of stock held by him, or so much thereof as shall be
necessary to satisfy the debts of the company. 
SEC. 32. If the debts of the company shall remain unsat-
isfiod, the court shall proceed to ascertain the respective liabili- 
tios of the directors or other officers, and of the stockholders,
and to adjudge the amount payable by each, and enforce such
judgment as in other cases. 
SEC. 33. Upon any application to tho court having juris-
diction, in a.ny of the cases provided in this chapter, such court 
may compel such corporation to discover any stock, property,
things in action, or effects, alleged to belong or to have belonged
to it, the transfer and disposition thereof, and the consideration,
and all the circumstances of such disposition. 
SEC. 34. Every officer, agent, or stockholder of any cor-
poration, against which proceedings shall be instituted accord- 
iug to the provisions of this chapter, and every person to whom
it shall be alleged that any transfer of property or effects of such
corporation has been made, or in whoso possession or control 
pelled, in tho discretion of tho court, to answer an action com­
menced to obtain any discovery in the preceding section speci­
fied, notwithstanding such answer may expose the corporation of
which he is a member, to a forfeiture of its corporate rights, or
any of them. 
SEC. 35. The answers of the officers and agents of o.ny
corporation shall be evidence against the corporation, in the 
same manner and to the same extent as if such answers had
been given upon an examination of such officers or agents as
witnesses in the cause ; and such officers or agents may subse­
quently be examined as witnesses by either party, under tho
order of the court; but no such answer shall be compelled,
unless by special order of the court. 
SEC. 36. Neither the answer of any such officer or agent,
nor his testimony upon any such subsequent examination, shall 
be used as evidence· upon any indictment or other criminal
prosccu tion or proceeding against him. 
SEC. 37. Whenever any action shall be commenced, or
any application shall be made, against any corporation, its direct- 
ors or other superintending officers, or its stockholders, according
to the provisions of this chapter, the court may by injunction, 011 
the application of either party, and at any stage of the proceed­
ings, restrain all proceedings by any creditor against the
defendants in such action; and whenever it shall appear neces­
sary or proper, may order notice to be published in such manner
as the court shall direct, requiring all the creditors of such cor­
poration to exhibit their. claims and become parties to the
action within a reasonable time, not less than six months from
the first publication of such order, and in default thereof, to be
precluded from all benefit of the judgment which shall be made
in such action, and from any distribution which shall be made
under such judgment. 
SEC. 38. The provisions of this chapter shall not extend
to any incorporated library or lyceum society, to any religious 
corporation, or any incorporated academy or select school, nor
to the proprietors of any burying ground, incorporated under the 
laws of this state.

and judgment of the court thereupon. 
SEC. 14. When an attachment shall be issued by the
special order of the court, a certificate to that effect shall be 
iudorsed thereon by the clerk of such court ; and if no sum be
specified in which the defendant shall be held to bail on such
writ, he shall not be entitled to be discharged from the arrest
thereon, upon executing any bond, or in any other manner,
unless upon the special order of tho court issuing the attachment. 
SEC. 15. When an attachment shall he issued without
re specia or er o t ie court, an an or er speer ymg e sum 
in which the defendant is to be held to bail, is not indorscd
thereon, the defendant shall ho discharged from the arrest
thereon, on executing a bond in the penalty of one hundred
dollars, with sureties, in the same manner and with the like
condition as hereinbefore specified. 
SEC. 16. Upon returning any attachment, the officer exe-
cu ting the same shall return the bond, if any, taken by him of 
the defendant, which shall be filed with such attachment. 
SEC. 17. The sheriff, or other officer, to whom any
attachment shall be delivered, shall return the same by the 
return day specified therein, without any previous rule or order
for that purpose; and in case of default, an attachment may be
issued against him of course, upon being allowed by a judge of
the court, or by an officer authorized to perform the duties of
such judge, upon proof of such default; and in such allowance
the cause of issuing the same shall be stated, and that the
defendant is not to be discharged upon bail, or in auy other
manner, but by the order of the court. 
SEC. 18. The officer to whom such last mentioned attach-
ment shall be delivered, shall execute the same by arresting and 
keeping the defendant in his custody, bringing him personally
before the court, and detaining him in such custody until the
order of the court. 
SEC. 19. When any defendant, arrested upon an attach-
meut, shall have been brought into court, or shall have appeared 
therein, the court shall cause interrogatories to be filed, specify-
ing the facts and circumstances alleged against the defendant,
and requiring his answer thereto; to which the defendant shall·
make written answers, on oath, within such reasonable time as
the court shall allow; and the court may receive any affidavits,
or other proofs, contradictory of the answers of the defendant,
or in confirmation thereof, and upon the original affidavits, such
answers, and such subsequent proof, shall determine whether the.
defendant has been guilty of the misconduct alleged. 
56 
SEC. 20. If the court shall adjudge the defendant to have
been guilty of the misconduct alleged, and that the misconduct 
was calculated to or actually did defeat, impair, impede, or prej-
udice the rights or remedies of any party in a cause or matter 
depending in such court, it shall proceed to impose a fine, or to
imprison him, or both, as the nature of the case shall require. 
SEC. 21. If an actual loss or injury has been produced to
any party by the misconduct alleged, the court shall order a 
sufficient sum to be paid by the defendant to such party, to
indemnify him, and to satisfy his costs and expenses, instead of
imposing a fine upon such defendant ; and in such case the pay­
.ment and acceptance of such sum shall be an absolute bar to any
action by such aggrieved party, to recover damages for such
injury or loss. 
SEC. 22. In all cases other than that specified in the pre­
ceding section, the fine shall not exceed two hundred and fifty
dollars, over and above the costs and expenses of the proceedings. 
SEC. 23. When the misconduct complained of consists in
the omission to perform some act or duty which is yet in the 
power of the defendant to perform, he shall be imprisoned only
until he shall have performed such act or duty, and paid such
fine as shall be imposed, and the costs and expenses of the
proceedings. 
SEC. 24. In such case the order and process of commit-
ment shall specify the act or duty to be performed, and the 
amount of the fine and expenses to be paid. .
SEC. 25. In all other cases where no special provision is 
o. ierwise ma e y aw, 1 impnsonmen or ere , 1 s ia
be for some reasonable time, not exceeding six months, and 
until the expenses of the proceedings are paid, and also, if a
fine be imposed, until such fine be paid ; and in the order and 
process of commitment the duration of such imprisonment shall
be expressed. 
SEC. 26. Persons proceeded ag ilnst according to the pro-
visions of this chapter shall also be liable to indictment for the
same misconduct, if it be an indictable offense ; but the court
before which a conviction shall be had on such indictment, shall
take into consideration the punishment before inflicted in form-
ing its sentence. 
SEC. 27. If the defendant, against whom an attachment
shall have been issued and return served, do not appear on the
return day thereof, the court may either award another attach­
ment, or may order the bond, taken on the arrest, to be prose­
cuted, or both. 
SEC. 28. Such order shall operate as an assignment of
the bond to any aggrieved party who shall be authorized by the
court to prosecute the same; and such party may maintain an
action thereon, in his own name, as assignee of the sheriff or
officer to whom the same was given, in the same manner as in
other actions on bonds with condition to perform covenants
other than the payment of money. 
SEC. 29. The measure of the damages to be assessed in
such action shall be the extent of the loss or injury sustained 
by such aggrieved party, by reason of the misconduct for which 
the attachment was issued, and his costs and expenses in prose-
cuting such attachment. 
SEC. 30. If there be no party aggrieved by the miscon-
duct for which the attachment was issued, the court, in case the 
defendant shall fail to appear, according to the condition of. the
bond taken on the arrest, shall order the same to be prosecuted 
by the attorney general, or by the district attorney for the county
in which the bond was taken, in the name of the officer who
took such bond. 
SEC. 31. In such case the whole penalty of the bond shall
be forfeited and recovered ; and from the money collected thereon 
the court shall order such sum to be paid to the party prosecut-
ing the attachment, as the court ordering the prosecution shall
think proper, to satisfy the costs and expenses incurred by him,
and to compensate him for any injury he may have sustained by
the misconduct for which such attachment was issued; and the
residue of such moneys shall be paid into the state treasury to
the credit of the school fund. 
SEC. 32. If on the return of an execution duly issued
upon any JU gment o tame upon sue on , 1t s a appear
that the sureties taken therein were, at the time of taking them,
insufficient, and that the officer taking them had reasonable
ground to doubt their sufficiency, he shall be liable in an action 
to the party aggrieved who may have prosecuted such action, for
tho amount of the judgment recovered by him, and for his costs
and expenses in such action ; or if such action was brought by
the attorney general or a district attorney, an action may, in
like manner, be brought by them, in the name of this state, for
the amount of the judgment so recovered; and the same disposition
of the moneys collected in such action against such officer shall be
made as directed in the preceding section. 
SEC. 33. Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter, an
offi.cer is required to keep any person arrested upon attachment 
in actual custody, and to bring him personally before any court,
the inability, from sickness or otherwise, of such person to attend 
such court personally, shall be a sufficient excuse for not bring- 
ing him before such court; nor shall any officer be required, in
any case, to confine any person arrested upon an attachment to 
answer for misconduct, in any prison, or otherwise to restrain
him of his personal liberty, except so far as shall be necessary 
to secure his personal attendance.

he is· entitled to his discharge, which allegations and denials
shall be on oath; and thereupon such officer shall proceed, in a

produced in support of such imprisonment or detention, or
against the same, and to dispose of such party as the justice of 
the case may require.

detained is illegally imprisoned, confined, or restrained of his
liberty, the officer shall grant a writ of discharge, commanding

disobedience shall forfeit to the party aggrieved one thousand
two hundred and fifty dollars, in addition to any special damages
such party may have sustained.

civil action for obeying any such writ or order of discharge ;

fering any person committed to his custody to go at large,
pursuant to any such writ or order, he may set forth the same
in his answer, in bar of such action. 
SEC. 30. No person who has been discharged by the order
of any officer upon a habeas corpus issued pursuant to the pro-
visions of this chapter, shall be again imprisoned, restrained, or
kept in custody for the same cause ; but it shall not be deemed
the same cause- 
1. If he shall have been discharged from a commitment for
the same offense, by the legal order or process of the court
wherein he shall 'be bound by recognizances to appear, or in 
which he shall be indicted or convicted for the same offense;
or- 
2. If, after a discharge for defect of proof, or for any mate­
rial defect in the commitment in a criminal case, the prisoner 
arrested on sufficient proof, and committed by legal
process for the same offense ; or-

illegality in the judgment or process hereinhefore specified, and

or shall knowingly aid or assist therein, he shall forfeit to the
party so aggrieved one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars,
and shall also be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.

power, any person who, by the provisions of this chapter, would

of any such writ, or to avoid the effect thereof, transfer any 
such prisoner to the custody or place him under the power or
control of another, or conceal him, or change the place of his
confinement, shall be deemed guilty of a· misdemeanor. 
SEC. 33. Any one having in his custody, or under his
power, any person for whose relief a writ of habeas corpus shall 
have been duly issued, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,

effect thereof, shall transfer such prisoner to the custody or
place him under the power or control of another; or conceal

imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court in which
he shall be convicted; but such fine shall not exceed one thou­
sand dollars, nor such imprisonment six months. 
SEC. 36. Whenever it shall appear by satisfactory proof
that any one is held in illegal confinement or custody, and that 
there is good reason to believe that he will be carried out of the
state, or suffer some irreparable injury, before he can be relieved
by the issuing of a habeas corpus, any officer authorized to issue
such writs may issue a warrant under his hand and seal, reciting
the facts, and directed to any sheriff, constable, or other person,
commanding such officer or person to take such prisoner, and
forthwith to bring him before such officer, to be dealt with 
according to law.
SEC. 37. When the proof mentioned in the last section 
shall also be sufficient to justify an arrest of the person having
such prisoner in his custody, as for a criminal offense, committed 
in the taking or· detaining of such prisoner, the warrant shall
 also contain an order for the arrest of such person for such 
offense. 
SEC. 88. Any officer or person to whom such warrant
shall be directed, shall execute the same by bringing the prisoner 
therein named, and the person who detained him, if so com-
manded by the warrant, before the officer issuing the same; and

or matter in question.

estate, which are annexed to my petition and herewith deliv­
ered, are in all respects just and true, and that I have not, at
any time or in any manner whatsoever, disposed of or made over
any part of my estate, for the future benefit of myself or my

debts. 
SEC. 5. The officer granting such order shall direct notice
of its contents to be published in a newspaper printed at the

agree upon theirverdict; and such verdict shall be conclusive in the
premises, unless reversed on writ of error, as hereinafter directed.

the instance of any creditor, touching his estate or debts, or any
matter stated in his schedule, and may be required to state any
change which may have occurred in the situation of his prop­
erty since the making of his schedule, and particularly whether
he has collected any debts or demands, or made any transfer of
any part of his real or personal estate ; but this shall not be con­
strued to prohibit any such creditor from contradicting or impeach­
ing, by other competent testimony, any evidence given by such
insolvent. 
SEC. 16. If it shall appear on such examination or other­
wise by competent proof, that such insolvent has collected any 
debts or demands, or made any transfer, absolute or condi­

shall be required to pay forthwith to the officer or to the clerk
of the court before whom the hearing shall be had, the full
amount of all debts and demands so by him collected or received,
and the full value of all property so by him transferred, except
such part of the said debts and property as shall satisfactorily
appear to the officer or court to have been necessarily expended

this chapter, unless such payment shall Le made, within thirty
days thereafter, to the assignees of such insolvent.

vent has hpnestly and fairly given a true account of his estate,
and has in all things conformed to the matters required of him

shall be pending, shall direct an assignment of all such insol­
vent's estate in possession, reversion, or remainder, except such
property as may be by law exempt from execution. 
SEC. 18. When any of the matters in the last section 
required to be established previous to granting an order of
assignment, shall have been submitted to a jury, as herein pro-
vided, and shall have been found in favor of the insolvent, such
finding shall be conclusive as to such matters, upon tho officer
or court before whom the proceedings are pending, and the
officer or court shall direct an assignment accordingly : provided,
that the jury may increase or diminish the amount of any debt
by such insolvent set forth in his schedule. 
SEC. 19. Such assignment shall vest in the assignees
all the interest of such insolvent at the time of executing the 
same in any estate or property, real or personal, whether such
interest be legal or equitable; but no contingent interest shall
pass to the assignees by virtue of such assignment, unless the
same shall become vested within three years after the making 
of the assignment, and in case of its becoming so vested, it
shall p'.lss to the assignees in the same manner as it would have
vested in such insolvent if no assignment had been made by 
him.

affidavit of one of them, stating that such insolvent has assigned 
and delivered for the use of all his creditors, all his estate so
di rected to be assigned, and all the books, vouchers, and secu-
rities relating to the same, and upon his also producing a certifi-
cate of the register of deeds of the proper county, that such

court who directed such assignment shall grant to such insol-
vent a discharge from his debts, which shall have· the effect
declared in the succeeding sections of this chapter.
