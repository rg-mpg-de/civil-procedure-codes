summons against the other partners named in the plea, and pro

had been included in the original suit. And if such partners,
named in said plea, cannot be found, the plaintiff or plaintiffs,
upon the return of said summons, may suggest in his declara

where service is only made on part of the defendants; and no
other plea in abatement, for nonjoinder of parties, shall be al

(a) if breaches of a bond, containing n collateral condition, are not assigned in the

declaration, the defendant, it is said, will not have an opportunity to plead several
matters, for he will be compelled to set forth his defence by rejoinder, and courts hold
that the authority to plead several matters, is not an authority to rejoin several mot
ters. The better practice, therefore, is, to set out the condition and assign the breaches
in the declamlion.-State 0. Cafes, 6 U. R., 1:30. But, see the 59th sec. of this chapter.
(b) In strict legal acceptntion, the plea of non estfuclum is not a general issue; but is

deemed so, in covenant, within the meaning ofthis section.-—Urmtger‘s ndm‘r v. Gran- ‘

(a) The court have no power to compel the tenant, or any other person, to become
defendant and make defence.

It is, however, discretionary with the court, under this

section. to admit persons who claim title, to be made party defendants to the action. if
the landlord of the persons in possession, who were served with the declaration, exhib
its aprimafacie right, he must be admitted to defend; and ifhe is a citizen or resident
of another state, the cause, upon his application, can be taken to the circuit court of the
United States—Doc v. Roe, 4 0. R., 435.
(b) “At common law,coparccneis and joint tenants were obliged to laya joint demise,

A collector‘s deed,purporting to be given upon a sale for taxes, though insuﬂ'icient to

A tenant, or those coming in under him, cannot eontrovert the title of the landlord.

Therefore, if A. enter into ossession of land under B., and B. claims to derive title
from 0., it seems that A s all not be permitted to prove that C never had any legal
title; for, it would. in effect, permit A. to dispute the title of B7 But where the land
lord's title expires subsequent to the demise, the tenant may show the fact that the title
of the landlord ha determined, and so defent'the action of ejectment brought by the
landlord—Lessee of Banach! v. Newman, 3 O. R., 57.

of school lands, under a sale for the nonpayment of rent, and was sued in ejectment for
the same lands by the heirs of the lessee; it was held, that the defendant should not be
permitted to impeach the validity of the lease—Lessee of Hart 1:. Johnson, 6 O. B., 87.
In ejectment, brought by the mortgagee against the mortgagor, the latter will not be

party accused may seek redress by a suit in slander, and recover. without proof of actual
damagev Where the words are false, the law infers malice, and where their‘natural
tendency is to injure, the law presumes damages. Where the slander is written and
published. it is denominated libel. A libel. in reference to individual injury, maybe
deﬁned to be a false and malicious publication against an individual, either in tint or
writing. or by pictures, with intent to injure his reputation, or expose him to pu lie ha
tred, contempt, or ridicule. Whatever charge will sustain a suit for slander, where the
words are merely spoken, will sustain a suit for a libel. if they are written or printed,
and published; and, it will be seen at one glance, that man charges, which, if merel
spoken of another, would not sustain a suit for slander. wi . if written or printed, an
published. sustain a suit for libel. Words of ridicule only, or of contempt. which merely
tend to lessen a man in public esteem. or to wound his feelings, will support a suit for
libel, because of their being embodied in a more permanent and enduring form; of the
increased deliberation and malignity of their publication; and of their tendency to pro
voke breaches of the mblic peace. This we understand to be the settled law of libel in
this state, sustained y the uniform decisions of our courts. without a single exception
within our knowledge."
It is a libel to charge a man with infringing upon a regularly granted patent for an

A charge that Aireceived a letter to convey, containing money. giving himself a

used the money, is a charge of larceny, and actionable. And where the proo in such
case showed that he opened the letter and took the money, but under circumstances
which rendered it doubtful whether a technical larceny was fully proved. and the jury
rendered a verdict for more titan nominal damages. the court granted a new trial.—
Chemile 1:. 1311.011. 6 U. B., 67.
Different sets of distinct words maybe charged in one count—Churchill v. Kcmble. 3

It is no defence. to plead that when the words were spoken the defendant named his

these facts is proper under the general issue. to mitigate the damages, doc—Heine: v.

A plea of justiﬁcation is bad on eneral demurrer, if it does not distinctly admit the
speaking-of the wards—Davis v. i lalthcws, 53 O. B., 257.
Where the words spoken were, “You are a thief: you stole geese." it was held that

Under the

the defendant has given any evidence in support of the plea of justiﬁcation, the plaintiff
may give evidence of his general good character. And although in all these cases the
parties must conﬁne themselves to general character, and no proof min he received of
character in respect to particular things, or as to particular facts, yet proof of circum
stances of suspicion, not amounting to a justiﬁcation, which led the defendant to utter
the slander, may be proved under the general issue, to lessen the degree of malice, and
to mitigate the damages—Detail v. Greenﬁeld, fi 0. R., 225.
ASSAULT AND BATTERY.—Ifih9 plaintiff counts on both an assault and battery, and
false imprisonment, and the damages assessed are under ﬁve dollars, he cannot recover
his costs—Bell v. Bales, 3 0. R., 380.

The pics. of guilty, upon indictment for an assault and battery, and judgment found

But such plea, like any other confession of ii party, may be controveried by him, in the
civil suit—Clark at al. v. Irvin, 9 O. R., 131.
A party siding or advising the commission of an assault and battery, is liable to the
party injured for the assault and battery, although not personally present at its com.

103. Seer. LXXXVII. That on the said writ of scire facias

may be proceeded against accordingly.
104. Snc'r. LXXXVIII. That the defendant, his heirs, exec
utors or administrators, shall be admitted to plead any matter,
(a) See ante p. 669, note.
There is no new Judgment recovered n on it scire facins to revive a jud ment: the
old one is called into action.—Norton 0. cover et al., 5 0. R., 178; Reyna : er al. v.
Ez‘rs of Rogers, 50. R., 169; lVolf v. Poundsford, 4 O. R., 397.
Where a judgment was revived, a writ of error on the order of revival obtained, and
a bond given on the writ oferror, held, that the bond extended to the judgment revived.
—Re
:1 al. v. Ex‘rs of Rogers, 5 O. R., 169.
So or as the debtor is concerned, the lien ofa revived judgment exists in all its ori
'nal force. But as to a bone ﬁde purchaser of land from the debtor, it is otherwise.—
or if, while the ﬁve years mentioned in the statute are running, and before their as i
ration, the judgment debtor sell and convey his land, and the creditor permit the ve
years to expire without issuing execution, and then revive his judgment, it will not ope
rate on the land sold—Norton 0. Beaver et (11., 5 O. R., 178
The whole record is before the court, when acting on the scire facial-r, and if the ori
'nsl judgment is for one sum, and the scire fncis and jud ent of rcVivor is for sno
t er sum, thefjudgment ot revivor is erroneous.— Wolf n. eu1idlford, 4 O. R., 397.
It is said, i the defendant brings a writ of error, and the judgment is superseded for
ﬁve years by bond being ﬁled, an the judgment below is nﬂirmed, execution may be
taken out on the judgment, after the ex iration of the ﬁve years; because the writ of
error was a supersedeas, and the plaint' was compelled to wait until its determination.
But this rule, it was held, is not applicable, where the execution is not superseded by
a bond being filed under the statute. So, it is said, if the plaintiff has been tied up by

an injunction for ﬁyeflyesrs, he may afterwards sue out an execution, without revivin
the j udgment; but if ve years have elapsed from the time the injunction was disso 05
as well as from the date of the last execution, the judgment is dormant.—Lyt1e at at. e.
Cin. Manufacturing Co., 4 O. R., 459.
If an execution is issued, and sale made. and more than ﬁve years afterwards the sale
and valuation are set aside by the consent of parties, no other execution can afterwards
issue without revivin the 'ud ment; and the law, it seems, presumes that the sale was
set aside bemuse the ebt ad
it paid or released. Such jud ment, therefore, unre
vived, is not entitled to money made on a junior judgment, in h 0. So, a senior judg
ment creditor, whose judgment is dormant, is not entitled to money made on a junior
judgment. It seems if execution is issued upon a dormant judgment, the court will,
on motion, set aside the execution, and award a restitution of the money—1d. lb.
If the defendant, in an action of debt upon a judgment, would avail himself of the
want of service of process and appearance in the ori inal action, he must crave oyer of
the record declared on and set it out; as matters of t at kind can only be proved by the
record—Evans ti. Incline, 6 O.R., 117.
It must appear, upon the face of a scire fecias, that time had elapsed since the judg
ment, for it to become dormant; Lessee qf Hough 1:. Norton et al., 9 O. ., 45; but it ll
not necessar that it should bespeciﬁcally averted that execution has not been issued for
a period of ffve years, if the scire facias sets forth the date of the judgment and the writ
bedsted, whereby it appears that more than five years have intervened—Weaver at al.
0. Reese, 6 . R., 418.
s
'
If, after a recovery in ejectment, the lessor of the plaintiff enter into a contract for the
sale of the land to the defendants, who are tenants in possession, he cannot subsequently
revive the judgment by scire facias, although payments on the contract are not made,
as stipulated. And, it is said, if, after jud ment, the plaintiff abandons the possession
of the premises, he has the fruit of his ju gment, and cannot afterwards revive it.—
Lcssee of Houin v. Norton et al.,9 O. R., 45.

O. R., 209. See also, ante p. 66‘), note.
How far the following decisions are applicable to the laws now in force, the reader
must determine.
If, after the death of a judgment debtor, thejudgment creditor revives his judgment,
he must proceed against the personal representative, if there be one, who has not settled
with the court as directed by the statute. But if there be no personal representative, or
the one appointed has made his ﬁn‘al settlement with the court, then the judgment
creditor ma proceed against the heirs or devisees; and these latter will beliable to the
extent of t eassets descended. It is therefore necessary to show, in the .rcirefacias
against the devisees or heirs, that there is no personal representative, or that the one
appointed has made his ﬁnal settlement with the court; and it ought further to a pear,
that assets have descended or been devised, whereby the heir or devisee can, wit

Orders, judgments and decrees, should be entered, at length. upon the journal, with
the same technical precision as is required in the complete record, made up in vacation.—
Harvey et al. a. Brown et al., 1 O. R., 268.

Acts ofthe court, to be valid, must, in general, be entered on the journal; but acts of
the sheriff, in court, calling for no judicial action, (such as his acknowledgment ofa
deed in open court,) are suﬁiciently authenticated by the certiﬁcate of the clerk, under
the seal of the mum—Lessee o/ Goudy v. Skunk, 8 U. R., 415.
The journal or daily minutes of the court are not so far a component part of the re
cord, that error can be assigned upon them. Error can only be assigned upon the com
plete record made up in the book of records—Harvey at al, a. Brown et al., 10. it, 268.

But as an instrument of evidence, the journal is deemed one of the records of the
court. Therefore, where a statute required the report of certain commissioners to be
entered of record in the ofﬁce of the clerk of the court of common pleas, and the amount
of damages assessed by them to be paid, before roperty should be appropriated for a
bridge, and an action of trespass was brought, and) the defendant justiﬁed by producing,
as well thejournals of the court where alone the proceedings were entered, as also parol
proof of the contents ofthe report, the original report being lost:_ it was held, that the
journals of the court were the records of the court, and the testimony oﬂ'ered, compe
tent.—Yoimg v. Buckingham £101., 5 O. R. 485.
So, the orders, minutes and decrees ofthe court, entered on the journal, “in those
cases in which no ﬁnal record is made, or is required to be made," are, it seems, legal
evidence and matter of record, if the court was in the exercise of its legitimate power
and authority—State v. Dawson etal., 6 O. R., 251.
So, it is said, a judgment is effectual before the complete record is made—Young v.
Buckingham et al., 5 U. R., 485-489,
For some purposes, it is said, the term of a court is considered an entire day, and the
journal bf everyday, so long as the term continues, is open to the correction of the
court.—~Forbet I. Cmftn, 6 O. R., 34

So, a court of record may alter, amend, or set aside ajudgmeut, at any time during
the term in which it was rendered, while the proceedings are considered as being in pa
per. The form in which applications for this urpose should be made, must depend,
chieﬂy, on the rules and ractice ofthe mum—51¢ Vickar v. Ludlow’s heirs, 2 0. R., 216.

(c) BILL or EXCEP'I‘IONS.——AB to a writ of error, see note to 1191b section.
The bill of exceptions is, in ractice and by law, to be signed and sealed only, not to
be prepared by thejudges; an the power of determining whether a bill of exceptions is
true or not, is vested in thejudgcs to whom it is resented for signature, who are only
bound to sign a true bill ofexceptioris.—Slate 0. odd at al., 4 O. R. 351.
A bill of exceptions cannot be tested by byestanders.—Dlurpliy v. tacos, 2 O. R., 255.
A bill of exceptions must be made a part of the record, or it will not be regarded by
the court, on writ of error. Therefore, if exceptions be made out and signed by the
Judges, and certiﬁed by the clerk to the supreme court as being the original bill of excep
tions on ﬁle, and the clerk attach it to the record, it will form no part of the rccord,and

will not be treated as a bill of sites dons—Acheson el. til. 1‘. H’estern Reserve Bank, 8
O. R., 117; Baldwin v. State, 6 O. ., 15.
I
If tht bill of exceptions is a naked statement offacls, and does not, in connection With

the reeord,show the materiality of the matter assigned as error, nor any injury sus
tained by the party, by reason of the decision of the court below, upon the matter as
signed, no foundaticn is laid for the reversal of thejudgment.——O.-bom v. State, 7 O. R.,
(Part 1,) 212-. Therefore, a mere abstract proposition, as applicable to any other case
as tlie_one in which it is stated, will not be noticed by the supreme court. The bill of

As To A NEW Titian—When on a motion for a new trial, the whole case is disclosed
to the court, and in its opinion the plaintiﬂ‘was entitled to a verdict which he obtained
and would again obtain‘, a new trial will not be granted; althou h the court, on the
trial, ruled a point oflaw incorrectly against the efendant, by wirich certain written
evidence was excluded from the jury—Laure of Hart a. Johnson, 6 0. R., 87; Leueeof
Earl v. Shoulder 6 O. R., 409.
It is no giround for a new trial that the court commented upon the evidence, in their
charge to t e jury—Laue: of Abrams a. Will, 6 O. R., 164.
_
In actions ofejectment, where the verdict is for the defendant, it is rarely set aside
for newly discovered evidence; Lessee of Glover's heir: v. Rujﬁn, 6 O. R., 255; and,
where it is against the defendant, a new trial, on account of the verdict being against
the weight oftlie evidence, will, in some cases, be granted, and will be ranted more
readily, than when the verdict is for the defendant.—Leuee of Muhlen :erg‘s heirs 1:.
Florence, 5 O. R., 245.
A verdict was founded upon presumptions and are] testimony, in regard to matters
of record, and the record or higher proof was pr uced, upon a motion tor a new trial,
and to show that the verdict was right.—~Lcute of Earl v. Shoulder, 6 O. R.. 409.
It is only when the verdict is palpany against the evidence, or the decided weight of
it, that courts are warranted in interfering to set it aside and grantin a new trial.
—Webb at al. v. Prolc. Ins. Co., 6 O. R., 456; Lessee of 4' uhlenberg‘: can a. Flor
ence, 5 O. R., 245.
The charge ofthe court upon which a new trial is asked, must have been material as
Selig a37enoneous.—Jordan el al. a. Jame: et al., 5 0. R., 88; Reed at al. v. McGrew, 5

A new trial will not be granted for a defect in pleading, unless the issues made up are
so imperfect that the court do not know for whom to give judgment.——Jm-don et al. v.
James at al., 50. R., 88-108.
A verdict will not beset aside with leave to plead, and a new trial granted, to let in
a mere twhnical defence, where substantial justlce has been done by the verdict.—Bush
at al. v. Critchﬁeld, 5 O. R., 109; Bales v. Cooper, 5 O. R., 115; nor where the verdict
is technically only against law; Hinton v. McNeil et al. 5 O. R., 509; nor because the
verdict is ainst equity, if it be conformable to the proof and the issue; Bales 1:. Cooper,
5 O R., 1%; nor upon the discovery ofan additional witness to a tact upon which evi
dence was given to the jury; nor to give a party an opportunity to impeach the wnncsses
of his adversary.—Recd et al. a. ﬂ'IcGrew, 50. R., 375.
_
If testimony was properly rejected, but for a wrong reason, it affords no ground for a
new trial.—Lessee of Ludlow‘s heirs v. Park, 4 O. R., 5.
_
When the motion is grounded upon the discovery of new and material evidence, the
newly discovered evidence must be disclosed, and the court will not inquire whether,
taking the newly discovered evidence in connection with that exhibited on the trial, a
jury might be induced to give a different verdict; but whether the legitimate effect of

such cvrdence would be to require a different verdict.—1d. lb.
When the court, upon the trial,err as to the law, and this circumstance does not affect
the ﬁnal decision of the cause, a new trial will not be granted—Coucier £1 01. v. Gra
Itam, 1 O. R., 330.
Ifa verdict is substantially just, the court will not, it seems, disturb it, because there
was no count in the declaration to meet the case made before the jury—Buck o. Wad

~

As a general rule, no one can complain of an error in a record or judgment, except
the person who has been injured thereby; Smith et al. v. Barber et al., 7 U. R , (Part 2,)
122; Reynolds et al. v. EI‘ra of Rogers, 5 O. R., 169; nor for a court giving a wrong
reason tor admitting proper evidence; lVesterham o. Clive, 5 O

R., 136; or for the

admission of proof ot allegations in the declaration, which under the issue, a party was
not bound to prove; Reynolds at al. v. Ez'ra of Rogers, 5

. R , 169; nor for erroneous

ly deciding a matter of fact submitted to them by consent of parties; Id. 1b.; nor for

errors committed by himselﬂ—Reynoldc el al. a. Er'rs of Rogers, 5 O. R., 169.
So, where error has intervened for the beneﬁt of a party, (as where a verdict against

the defendant is for one sum, and judgment for a. less sum, without remittitur,) he can
not, in general, have the judgment reversed upon writ of erron—Slcrn'tt v. Creed, 2 O.

When the judgment of reversal contains evidence of the precise thing to be restored,
and does not depend upon evidence dehors the record, the writ of restitution ma

be

awarded. But execution cannot be awarded on the 'udgment of restitution, i the

of the common law." Therefore no a peal lies from the decision of the court of com

A compliance with the requisitions of the statute in re rd to an appeal to the su

An appeal does not lie from a nonsuit, unless it is shown from the entries of the court

It is said the most usual object sought by this writ is to exact the execution of some
official duty from a ministerial oﬁicer; In the mailer of James Turner, 5 O. R., 542;
Smith v. (.'o1n‘rs Portage Co., 9 O. R., 25; but it is e uallv applicable to compel courts
to do that justice which the law enjoins them to administer. Whenever an inferlor
court reluses to exercise its jurisdiction, the writ of mandamus is the appropriate rem
edy. It is not a rented adapted to correct errors, or to constrain them to act in a par
ticular manner. The all object of the writ is obtained if it produces action, and calls
forth the exercise ofjurisdiction.-—lnlhe matter qf James Turner, 5 O. R., 2.

A mandamus may issue to the court of common pleas to enforce the signing of a bill
of exccptions,but not to compel the court to sign a particular bill of exceptions—Stalling them to perform any public duty, specially enjoined upon
them by any provision of law, if it shall appear to 'the court
that such ofﬁcer, or any member of such body, or board, has,
without just excuse, refused or neglected to perform the duties
so enjoined, the court may impose a ﬁne upon every such ofﬁcer
or member of such body or board; and such ﬁne, when collect
ed, shall be paid into the treasury of the county; and the pay

incurred by such ofﬁcer, or member of such body or board,

A declnration in case, for erectinga dam, 41.0., ncrossa navigable stream, alleging
that the plaintiff‘s boat was wrecked in passing over the dam, is sustained by proof that

It was held, in an action against A., alone, upon the agreement,

that the indorsement should be declared upon us a part of the original agreement, if
made at the time ofthe execution of the original agreement, and whether it formed a

In an action on the case, for an injury done to water pipes, in a public street, ifthe

plaintiff undertakes to set out. his title,_ he must set out a good one, or the defendant
may demur generally.

Where a plaintiff, in such case, claims title under it town ordinunce, and from his declaration it appears, that his rights depend“upon certain terms in
said ordinance expressed," the terms of the ordinance must be set out. The plaintiff, it
is said, might perhaps, have rested his title upon his possession—Cincinnati Water
Company 1;. Cincinnati, 4 O. R., 443.
It is error to render judgment on a verdict for a greater amount than the damages
demanded in the declaration. In such case, the court might, perhaps, after reversmg
thejudgment, enter such 'udgment us thecourt of common pleas ought to have render
ed, upon condition that t e plaintiff below remits the excess ofthe verdict.—Powell v.

The plea of non atfaclum, to a scire fucias to make personal representatives parties

1. SECTION I. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the
:21; 8183111- State of Ohio, That the court of common pleas shall have juris

diction in all cases properly_c0gnizable by a court of chancery,
in which plain, adequate, and complete remedy cannot be had
at law. (a)
(a) JURISDICTION or m coca-r or CHANCERY.—Tl'lﬂl a court of chanccry has juris
diction in those cases where “a plain, adequate and complete remedy cannot be had at
law." is, it is said, the apothegm by which the power is limited, in every country where
the distinction 18 known between courts of law and equity. The extent of the restric
tion has long since been deﬁned. It is a technical maxim, adopted by our legislature
in its technical sense, and receives the same interpretation here as elsewhere. It is a
part of the general chancery law, that where a class of'cascs are the objects of chancery
jurlsdiction, that jurisdiction is not taken away because courts oflaw subsequently ad
minister a remedy. Therefore, it was held a settled course of chancery, at the instance
of creditors, legatces and the rest of kin, to compel an account and distribution ofdece
dent‘s estates, against executors and administrators. The position they occupy is not
in their own right, but ﬁduciary; any one, whose interests they hold, may enforce them,
through chancery, to perform their duty in the execution of the trusl.~ Cram e! n]. v.
Green (I 0.1., G O. R., 429.


2. SECT. II. The supreme court shall have concurrent juris- ——Concurrent
diction with the courts of common pleas, in all cases properly and appellate of
supreme court;
cognizable by'a court of chancery, where the title to, or any
contract in relation to land is in question, or the sum or matter
in dispute exceeds one thousand dollars in value; and appellate
jurisdiction in all cases regularly brought before them, from the
chancery decisions of the courts of common pleas.
3. Sac-r. Ill. The said courts shall have power to make rules —May estab

of courts of equity, except where it may be otherwise provided in chancery;
by law.
4. Seer. IV. All applications to the chancery side of either —App&mijtions

pe
of said courts, shall be by petition, settin forth the nature and tition,
ﬁled'.
grounds of the complainant’s claim, whici shall be ﬁled in the
ofﬁce of the clerk of such court.
5. Seer. V. The clerk, on the application of the complain Subpoana to is
ant or his solicitor, shall, after said petition is ﬁled, issue a sub—

ptena to the defendant or defendants named in said petition,
commanding him or them to appear at the next term of the court,
When a person has an option, from the nature of his claim, to resort to a court of
chancery, or a court of law, he cannot, after selecting one tribunal,and being there de
feated by an erroneous decision, resort to the other.—Buell v. Cross, 4 0. R., 327.
An objection to the jurisdiction, in general, comes too late, after a defendant has an

swered and contested the merits—Rees v. Smith, 1 O. R., 124.
A court ofchancery will take jurisdiction, to subject the estate of a deceast obligor

an
equitable estate in lands to the payment 0 ajudgment which could not be brought to
sale except under a decree; Id. 1b.; Piatl v. St. Clair‘s heirs, 6 O. R., 227; to relieve

from a penalty: as when a. person takes from a borrower of money an obligation for a
greater amount than the money lent and interest, with an undertakin on the part of
the lender to receive a less sum in dischar eof the obligation, if punctual y paid. When
the court thus relieve from the sanity, t e complainant should,in general, brin into
court, at the time of ﬁling his bi l, the amount really due, if it be injudgment,— rock
way v. Clark, 6 O. R., 45. The court will carry into effect the intention of the parties,
when, by fraud or mistake, such intention is not embodied in a written contract.—Hu1tt
et al v. Freeman, 10. R., 490; Edwards a. Morris, 1 O. R., 524. And see Lab 1:.
Parks 21 al., 4 O. R., 469. But a part , seeking to set up in chancery a contract, di er
ent from the written one, upon whic judgment has been had at law, must show an
offer to perform the contract he claims to establish, at the time it ought to have been
perlormed, and a readiness to still perform itz—As where a. note was by mistake ivenJ
ayable in current bank notes of t e city of Cincinnati, instead of notes of the 5 iami
‘xporting Company; and it was held that a statement_ of the payec,beiore the time of
payment, that he would not receive the bank notes which by the contract he was bound
to receive, would not excuse a tendon—Edwards v. Morris, 1 O. R.,‘524.
So a court of chancery will enjoin a sale of real estate on execution, where the sale
would confer no title, but would cast a cloud upon the title of the complainant—Nor
ton v. Beaver at al., 5 O. R., 178; Bank U. States v. Schultz, 2 O. R., 4‘71.
_
Equitable estates in land are in general subjected, in courts of equit , to the same
zules which govern legal estates in courts of iﬂW.—Campbell et al. v.
98

also", 8 O. R.,

When a party claims the beneﬁt of a covenant, and there is a prior condition to be
performed by him, which is set up as a bar and forfeiture of the beneﬁt of the covenant,
on account of the nonperformance of such condition, it is said: “Where, from the na
ture of the a rcement, the penalty is only intended as a security that thecousideration
shall be per ormcd, a court of equity may relieve; for, notwithstanding they do so, they
give the party that which he stiplulated to receive, and therefore no injury is done; but
where the relief would destroy t e substance of the contract, as if the thing stipulated
be a collateral act, relief cannot be granted, for no precise valuecan be aﬂixe to such an
act.

In the case before its, the condition was the performance of an act to third per

sons, and the inconvenience resulting from the nonperformance cannot be determined,

and of course there is no criterion for ﬁxing a compensation."—Hutchemn a. McNutt'a
hire, 1 0.R., 14—2].

The purchaser of land paid a portion of the purchase money, neglected to perform
the contract any further, and brought his action at law to recover back the money paid.
He satisﬁed the jury, upon full defence being made by the seller, that the contract had
been abandoned and put an end to byeléolh parties, and obtained a verdict and judg
ment. In fact, the contract had not
n abandoned ,or put an end to, and the seller,
two years after the rendition of the Judgment, ﬁled his bil in chancery to have the con,

tract enforced. and the Judgment enjomed. It was held by the court, that the matter
had been adjudicated upon at law, and no relief, therefore, could be obtained in chan
cery. It was said: “Had the present bill been ﬁled during the pendency of the suit at
law, and had no defence been made in that case, this court might, and probably would
have given relief. The seller had a right to elect, and did elect, to make full defence in
that court."—Curlt's et al. v. Cisna’s adm‘rs, 1 O. R., 429.

supposed to reside, directed to any proper ofﬁcer therein, who owmnCZ'Lagp'
shall serve and return the same. And in cases where any or
all of the defendants reside out of this state, the complainant
may cause personal service of a subpoena, with a copy of the
petition; or he may cause notice of the pendency of the petition,
containing a summary statement of the object and prayer there
of, to be published six consecutive weeks, in some newspaper
printed in the county where the petition is ﬁled, if there be any,
and if not, in some newspaper printed in this state, of general
circulation in the county. (a)

The service of a subpoena, or other process How subpcsna,

for appearance, shall be by delivering a copy thereof to the de- ﬁtéfgzmﬂem'

indorse on the original, the time and manner of service.

And def‘tsconsider

when the service is made out of this state, the return shall be all“ mu"
veriﬁed by oath or afﬁrmation; and upon return of service of
the process, or due proof of notice having been given as afore
said, the defendants shall be considered in court. ([1)
(a) The above section remained in force until February 2'3, 1835, when it was rcpt-tiled \
and the following passed, to supply itsplace: 33 v. Stat,, 13.
Sec. 4. That when the complainant shall make several defendants to his petition,
who reside in different counties of this state, the clerk of the court in which the same is
ﬁled, may issue subpmnas into the several counties in which said defendants are sup
posed to reside, directed to any proper ofﬁcer therein, who shall serve and return the
same; and in case when the tit \- to, or boundaries oflands, or tent ments, are drawn in
question in chancery, and any or all of the defendants are nonresidents of the state, suits
ma be prosecuted in any county where the land lies; and in all cases where any or all
oft e defendants are nonresitlents of the state, the courts shall direct the manner of
giving notice to the absent defendants.
The act of Feb. 23, 1835, continued in force until March 14, 1838, when the section to
which this note is appended was revived,and the act of Feb. 23, 1835, re aled; for which,

see 74th section of'this chapter. As to opening decrees, where the de endant’s appear
ance has been effected by publication, see 57th section of this chapter.
(b) As 'ro 'rnr: at‘Ltzs asLti'rixo T0 Lis Pastime—When the process is by subpmna,
the suit is commenced and is pendin by the service of the writ upon the party, so as to
charge third persons with notice oft e pendency ofthe suit. And when the defendant
is brought into court by the publication of a notice, and the notice has been duly pub
lished in contormity to the order of the court, the suit is to be considered as commenced
and pending from the time that the ublication is completed, so as to charge third per
sons with notice of the pendency oft e strit, although the proof of the publication is to
be afterwards returned to the court. The urchaser of the subject matter of a suit, at
any time after its commencement and pen ency, as above mentioned, acquires no inter
est, as against the complainant’s'title, whether that title be legal or equitable—Lud
low's heirs v. Kidd el 01., 3 O. R.,54l; Lessee QfBemtct v. Williams, 5 O. R., 461. The
decree of the court binds~ the property in the hands of such purchaser, although he is no
party to the suit, and paid a full price for it, and had, in fact, no notice ofthe pendency
ofthe suit, or the claim ofthe complainant.——1ti. 1b. This rule ofconstructive notice of
the pendency and subject matter of a suit, when there is no notice in fact, does not. in
general, extend beyond the termination ofa suit; and therefore, a ﬁnal decree is not, by

An appeal to the supreme court has never been supposed, it is said, to be any thing
other than a proceeding in the ori inal cause, and that a purchaser, after a decree in the
common pleas, was, notwithstan ing the appeal, liable to be aﬁccted by the subsequent

proceedings in the supreme court, should the decree be there altered or reversed.-~1d. I6.
Until the service of a citation upon a writ of error, the writ of error is not to be con

be considered as a new and original suit.—Lessee of Taylor v. Boyd, 3 O. R., 337. See
note to 35th section of this chapter.

Judgment was reversed, pending a bill in chancery to Subject land to satisfy it. The
bill was continued in court, and judgment again recovered. A supplemental bill was
then ﬁled to reach the case of the secondjudgment. It was held that an alienation, after
the reversal ofthe judgment, and before the second judgment was rendered, was affec

ted by the pendency of the suit in chancery.'——-Lcssee of lodllard v. Myers,8 O. R., 203.
(a) As 'ro PARTIES—\Vllﬁl'e a bill is ﬁled against heirs, on their nncestor‘s contract,

A bill was ﬁled to subjectan equitable estate in lands to the payment ofajudgment,
all

ing that the defendant had purchased and paid for the land, but refused to take a

doe therefor, with a view of keeping it out of the reach of creditors. It appeared from
the answer that the defendant occupied the land by the permission of the owner, under
a parol agreement, that the occupation should continue durin the lifetime of the re~
spondent. The court held, that the facts made out a case so di erent from that stated
in the bill, as to render it impossible to give relief, in any form, under the bill.— Wag
goner o. Speck elal., 3 O. H., 292.
Where a creditor proceeds under this section against persons who owe his debtor,
and marshals an unreasonable amount 0f debts, the 'udgment debtor may apply to the
court to compel the complainant to select the claims e will proceed against, and in de

fault of his making such selection, the court will determine what claims shall be pro
ceeded upon, rind discharge the residue. If no such application be made, all the defen
dants will remain bound. If, pendin the suit, the summoned debtors make payment
to thejudgment debtor, they may sti l he made liable to the complainant; he who last
paid being ﬁrst liable. Ifone ofa ﬁrm be omitted as defendant, and he pays the part

nership debt to the judgment debtor, it will not affect the claim of the complainant
against the ﬁrm, unless the matter be regularly pleaded in abatement—Gilmore et al.

It was held: 1. That arlisle obtained no interest in the land by his purchase, and
that, therefore, Douglass obtained nothing by his purchase, it being butan equitable ee

tate. 2. Ifthejudgment of Douglass against Carlisle is subsisting and due, the 'udg
ment of Carlisle against U. is also subsisting and due. Carlisle being insolvent, oug
lass had a right to proceed against a debtor ofCarlisle to obtain satistaction ofhis 'udg
ment against Carlisle. Such a debtor to Cnrlisle is U., and Douglass should be ai ed in
chancery, to thus obtain satisfaction from U., as a debtor ot'Carlisle, by subjecting the
equitable estate which U. had in this land to the payment ofthcjudgment, were it not

that Huston had obtained_an assignment of the judgment ofCarlisle against U. 3.
Douglass acquired no lien in equity upon the judgment due by U. to Carlisle, until he

conveyance, release, or acquittance, in either of said courts, sit
ting as a court of chancery, and the party against whom the
said decree shall pass, does not comply therewith by the time
appointed, then such decree shall be considered and taken in all
courts of law and equity, to have the same operation and effect,
and be as available as if the conveyance, release, or acquittance,

had been executed conformany to such decree. (a)
It is said that a decree is not less erroneous that it has not 0 rated to the prejudice
of an onIe. J'g‘harefore, a decree, that infants shall convey with)0warranty, will be re

Where, by decree, a bond was directed to be executed and delivered within a certain
time by the complainant to the defendant, and the bond was made and delivered to the
clerk of the court, instead ofthe defendant, within the time prescribed; on motion, at a

subsequent term, the court enlarged the time for the pertormunce of the decree—Baird
u. Shepherd, 2 O. R., 262.

lfthe court is equally divided in pipinion upon_ the question of relief, the bill must be
distttisscd.— W'uddle d a]. 0. Bank
Slates, 2 O. R., 339.
The doctrine ofcompensation, abatement and modiﬁcation is this: The complainant
asks for a decree, and it may be granted to him upon terms: he may be told that he
shall take less or give more than the terms of the contract specify, but at his option; for,
the court cannot tell the complainant that he shall takeless or give more, as that would
give him no option—Cousin et al- v. Graham, 2 O. R., 339.
Upon a bill to carry into execution a former decree, the court will not, in general, ex
amine into thejustice of the decree, or its law. Cases, it is said, have occurred in courts
of chancery of other countries, in which this rule has been relaxed, to correct mistakes
discovered from an examination into the proofs originally taken in the cause, or the
directions given—Em et al. v. Strong 2! al., 2 0. R., 401.
As TO A DISCONTINUANCE arm DISMISSAL—It is dangerous to discontinucin chancery,
if the complainant intends to again proceed by a new bill. In such case, he should have
his bill dismissed without prejudice—French's hair: 1:. French at al., 8 t). R.,214.
A bill was ﬁled by the purchaser of land to procure a deed. The seller was ready to
convey, bttt a portion of the purchase money was not paid. The bill was dismissed,
generally; and, it seems, on account of the nonpayment of the purchase money.

The seller then brought ejectment,and obtained possession of the land. The purchaser then
ﬁled a new bill to procure a deed, averting tender of the purchase mone . and readiness
to pay, &c.~ It was held, that the dismissal was a bar to future procee ings, and could
not be avoided by investigating the grounds upon which the court dismissed the ﬁrst
bill. It is said, “the rights of the parties were before the court upon the ﬁrst hill, and
all were investigated. and the com lainant must abide by the shape in which he chose
to submit them. Like a bill to re eem a men ge, ifit be dismissed without reserva
tion, for the nonpayment oi the money within t e ttme limited, it is a ﬁnal decree, and
works a foreclosure, because it concludes all rights.“— Wilcox v. Balgcr, 6 O. R., 406.
A decree of dismissal in the court ofcommon pleas, although pronounced as a matter
of form, the parties understandin that the cause was to be appealed to thc supreme
court, and there repared for a full investigation, is ﬁnal and conclusive upon the rights
of the parties, if t 10 appeal is not consummated.— lVltite v. Bank U. Stales, 6 0. R., 528.
(a) Dscttsss son coxvsnrvcs or Larva—Previous to the act of February 19. 1810,
which took elfect May 1, 1810, (Chase, 685,) all decrees in chancery, rendered by the

courts of this state were to be enforced by ac uestrution or execution. By the 41st sec
tion of the act of February 19, 1810, the provisions of the section to which this note is
appended were adopted, nttd have continued in the statutes to the present time. This
provision does not divest the court of the power to enforce the execution of a deed by
attachment for contempt.——.Randall v. Pryor, 4 O. R., 424

If no conveyance has been made in pursuance of a decree, its reversal, as between
the parties, divests the title, and reinvests it in the person in whom it was before the
decree—Lessee of Taylor v. Boyd 3 O. R., 337.
If the time limited in the decree for the execution of the deed has trans ired, (and so
the decree- become an absolute title,) and the party, thus invested with tlie title, after
wards sclls and conveys the land. in good faith before a citation on error is served, a
reversal of the decree will not affect the title of the innocent purchaser.—Id. Ib.
A decree, in the absence of any statute on the subject, is not notice to a subsequent
purchaser.—Tumer v. Crebill rt 01., 1 O. R., 372. See 72d section of this chapter, and
note thereto.
A decree of the circuit court of the United States, made in that court, sitting for the
district of Ohio, directing the conve ance‘of lands, does not operate as such conveyance,

in dispute be of the value of twenty dollars; and, in either case,

The condition of a bond, given upon the allowance of an injunction to sta waste,
may cover as well the costs of the original bill, as damages arising from the efendsnt
bging prevented from proceeding in the matter enjoined —Kent at al. v. Bit-roe, 6 O. R.,
3 6.
Where an injunction bond is given, and the court afterwards order the injunction to
be continued, “the complainant givinvfurlher bond," 62.0. and a detective bond, condi
tioned for the payment of costs on y, is given, the ﬁrst end will not thereby be dis
charged—Kent v. Bierce, 7 O. R., (Part 2,) 2'09; But if the order ofthe court he to give
a new bond, in place of, and as a substitute for the first one, and it is done, the ﬁrst bond
is discharged—Km! et al. v. Bierce st 01., 6 O. R., 336.
An injunction to restraina. mere trespass, is not, in general, allowed, unless the
property upon which the injury is committed, would be destroyed by repeated acts of
trespass, and is of a peculiar value that will not admit of common law recompense.—
'I‘hercfore, the keeper of a ferry across the Ohio river, from the Virginia to the Ohio
shore, who lands passengers upon the premises of the keeper of a terry on the Ohio
shore, is a mere trespasscr, whom a court of chancery will not restrain by an injunc
tion—Ross v. Page, 6 U R., 166.
It seems a court of chancer may restrain b injunction the doin of an act from
which irreparable injury may e done to indivi uals or to the public. gl‘he supervisor of
