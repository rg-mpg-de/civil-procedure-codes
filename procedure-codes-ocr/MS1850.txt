plaintiff supposes himself entitled, and if the recovery
of money be demanded, the amount thereof shall
be stated.

o so, it may be disregarded; it may be taken to the
whole complaint, or any of the alleged causes of action
stated therein, and when any of the matters
hereinbefore enumerated, do not appear upon the
complaint, the objection may be taken by qnswer;
and if no such objection be taken, either by demurrer
or answer, the defendant shall be deemed to have
waived the same, excepting only the objection to the

complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action.
SEC. 4. Be it further enacted, That the answer
of the defendant shall contain: 1st. In respect to
each allegation of the complaint, controverted by the
defendant, a general or specific denial thereof; or a
denial thereof according to his information and belief,

without repetition, and in such a manner as to enable
a person of common understanding to know what is
intended; and the defendant may set forth by answer
as many defences as he shall have; they shall each
be separately stated, and refer to the causes of action,
which they are intended to answer, in any manner,
by whiph they may be intelligibly distinguished; the
defendant may demur to one or more of several
causes of action, stated in the complaint, and answer
the residue; whenever it shall appear to the court
that the answer, or dbrhurrer of defendant is obviously
intended for delay) it may be stricken out on motion.
SEC. 5. Be it further enacted, That when the
answer shall contain new matter, the plaintiff may reply to it, denying generally, or particularly each
allegation controverted by him, or any knowledge or
information thereof sufficient to form a belief; and
he may allege in ordinary and concise language,
without repetition, and in such a manner as to enable
a person of common understanding to know what is
intended, any new matter not inconsistent with the
complaint, in avoidance of the answer, or of any defence
set up therein; or he may demur to the same
for insufficiency, stating in his demurrer the grounds
thereof; and the plaintiff may demur to one or more
of several defences set up in the answer, and reply to
the residue; if the answer contain a statement of new
matter constituting a defence, and the plaintiff fail to

and if the case require it, a writ of inquiry of
damages may be issued; if a reply of the plaintiff to
any defence set up by the answer of the defendant
be insufficient, the defendant may demur thereto, and

SEC. 6. Be it further enacted, That no other
pleading shall be allowed than the complaint, answer,
and demurrer; every pleading in the Circuit courts this State must be subscribed by the party or his attorney, and when any pleading in a case shall be
verified by affidavit, all subsequent pleadings, except
demurrers, shall be verified also; and in all cases of
a verification of a pleading, the affidavit of the party
shall state, that the same is true of his own knowledge,
except as to the matters and things, which are therein
stated on his information, or belief, and as to those
matters, he believes them to be true; and when a
pleading is.verified, it shall be by the affidavit of theparty,
unless he be absent from the county where the
the suit is commenced, or from some cause unable to,
verify it, or the facts are within the knowledge of
his attorney, or other persbn verifying the same;.
when the pleading is verified by the attorney, or any
other person except the party, he shall set forth in
the affidavit his knowledge, or the grounds of his belief
on the subject, and the reasons why it is not
made by the party; when a corporation is a party,.
the verification may be made by any officer thereof;
and when the State, or any officer thereof in its behalf
is a party, the verification may be made by any
person acquainted with the facts; and it shall not be
necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the
items of an account therein alleged, but he shall file
with his complaint or other pleading a copy of the
account verified by his own oath, or that of his agent
or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true,
or be precluded from giving evidence thereof; the
court may, in its discretion, order a further or more
particular bill.
SEC. 7. Be it further enacted, That in the concharges,
struction of a pleading, for the purpose of deternining
its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed,
with a view to substantial justice between the
parties; irrelevant or redundant matter, inserted in
in any pleading, may be stricken out on motion of
any party aggrieved thereby; and when the allegations
of a pleading are so indefinite, or uncertain,
that the precise nature of the charge or defence is not
apparent, the court may require the pleading to be
made definite by amendment; in pleading a judgment,
or other determination of a court, or officer of
special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state
the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment
or determination may be stated to have been duly
given or made; if such allegation be controverted,
the party pleading the same shall be bound to establish,
on the trial, the facts showing such performance;
in pleading the performance of conditions precedent
in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the
facts showing such performance, but it may be stated
generally, that the party duly performed all the conditions
on his part; and if such allegation be controverted,
the party pleading shall be bound to establish,
on the trial, the facts showing such performance; in
pleading a private statute, it shall be sufficient to refer
to it by its title and the day of its passage.
SEC. 8. Be it further enacted That in action for
libel or slander, it shall not be necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts, for the purpose ofslander.
showing the application to the plaintiff of the defa.
.matory matter, out of which the cause of action arose;
but it shall be sufficient to state generally, that the
same was published or spoken, concerning the plaintiff,
and if such allegation be" controverted, the plaintiff
shall be bound to establish, on trial, that it was
spoken or published; and in such actions the defendant
may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the
matter charged as defamatory, and any mitigating
circumstances, to reduce the amount of the damages;
and whether he prove the justification or not, he may
gIive in evidence the mitigating circumstances.
SEC. 9. Be it further enacted, That the plaintiff
may unite several causes of action in the same com- plaint, where they are all embraced in either of the following classes, to-wit: "1st. Where they arise
out of contract, express or implied; or, 2d. Injuries,
with or without force to the person; or, 3d. Injuries,
with or without force to property; or, 4th. Injuries
to character; or, 5th. Claims to recover real property,
with or without damages for withholding thereof, and
the rents and profits of the same; or, 6th. Claims to
recover personal property, with or without damages
for the withholding thereof; but the causes of action,
so united, must all belong to one of these classes, and
must affect all parties to the action, and not require
different places of trial, and must be separately stated.
SEc. 10. Be it further enacted, That every material
allegation of the complaint, not specifically controverted
by the answer, as prescribed in section four,
and every material allegation of new matter in the
answer, not specifically controverted by the reply, as
prescribed in section five, shall, for the purposes of
the action, be taken as true; but the allegation of
new matter in a reply, shall not in any respect conclude
the defendant, who may on the the trial, coun,
tervail it by proofs, either in direct denial, or by way
of evidence.
SEC. 11. Be it further enacted, That no variance between the allegation and the proof shall be deemed unless it have actually misled the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or
defence, upon the merits; whenever it shall be al-
leged that a party has been so misled, that fact shalt
be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and in
what respect he has been misled, and thereupon the
court may order the pleadings to be amended upon
such terms as may be just; but when the variance
is not material, the court may direct the fact to be
found, according to the evidence, or may order an
immediate amendment without costs; where, however,
the allegation of the cause of action or defence
to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in
some particular or particulars only, but in its entire
scope and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of
variance, either material or immaterial, but a failure
of proof.
SEC. 12. Be it further enacted, That any pleading
may be once amended by the party of course,
without costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings
already had: Provided, the same be made at
or before the second term of the court after filing the
complaint, or upon the appearance of the party in
court; and the pleadings shall, in all cases, be made
up and prepared for trial at the second term of the
court after the filing of the complaint, when the party
shall be duly in court, unless special cause shall be
shown by either party requiring further time.
SEc. 13. Be it further enacted, That the court
may at any time, in furtherance of justice, and on
such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading, by
adding or striking out the name of any party, or a
mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other
allegations material to the case, or by conforming the
pleadings to the facts proved; the court may, in its
discretion, allow an answer or reply to be made after
the the first term, and whenever any proceeding
taken by a party fails to conform in any respect to
the provisions of this act, the court shall have power
to permit an amendment of such proceeding, so as to
make it conformable to law.
SEC. 14. Be it further enacted, That after demurrei,
either party may amend any pleading demurred
to of course, and without costs: Provided, the
same be done during the term of the court, when the
demurrer is decided; but a party shall not, so amend,
more than once; upon the decision of a demurrer,
the court may, upon such terms as may be just, allow
any party to withdraw the same and plead over;
when the plaintiff shall be ignorant of the name of
a defendant, such defendant may be designated in
any pleading by any name, and when his true name
shall be discovered, the pleading may be amended
accordingly.
SEC. 15. Be it further enacted, That the court shall in every stage of the action, disregard any error, or defect, in the pleadings or proceedings, whichpleadings.
shall not affect the substantial rights of the adverse
party; and no judgment shall be reversed or affected
by reason of such error or defect; the plaintiff and
defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on motion,
to make a supplemental complaint, answer or reply,
alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the
former complaint, answer or reply, or of which the
party was ignorant, when his former pleading was
made.
SEC. 16. Be it further enacted, That all attach- returnable into the Circuit courts of this State, the court may, on motion of the defendant, order an
issue to a jury to be made up and, tried during the
term to which such attachment is returnable, to determine,
whether the same was wrongfully sued out;
and if the jury shall find, that such attachment was
wrongfully sued out, it shall be dismissed with costs
and damages, to be assessed by such jury against the
party thus wrongfully suing out of the same; but
if the issue shall be determined against the defendant
in attachment, he shall be permitted to answer upon
such terms as the court shall think just.
SEC. 17. Be it further enacted. That the process to bring a party into court, in all suits commenced
under the provisions of this act, shall be a summons,
which shall be tested, issued, endorsed, made returnable
and executed in the manner now prescribed by
law for the teste, issuance, endorsement, return and
execution of similar process.
SEc. 18. And be it further enacted, That this act
shall take effect and be in force from and after the
first day of July next.
