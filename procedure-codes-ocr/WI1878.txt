? roper party defendant to an action to establish or enforce, redeem
rom, or discharge a lien or claim to any real or personal property, in
this state, as heir, grantee, legal representative or otherwise, is unknown
to the plaintiff, such defendant or person may be designated a defend
ant by so much of the name as is known, or by a fictitious name, or as
an unknown heir, representative, owner or person, as the case may re
quire, adding such description as may reasonably indicate the person
intended, and such person shall be regarded a defendant in the action,
and as sufficiently described therein, for all the purposes thereof, in
cluding service of the summons, as upon an absent defendant or other
wise, appointment of guardian, if an infant, and liability to be bound

or friend of the infant. If made by a relative or friend of the
infant, notice thereof must first be given to such guardian, if he have
one; if he have none, then to the person with whom such infant
resides.
2. "When the infant is defendant, upon the application of the infant,
if he be of the age of fourteen years, and apply within twenty days after

lect so to apply, then upon the application of any other party to tie
action, or of a relation, or friend of the infant, after notice of such
application being first given to the general or testamentary guardian of
such infant, if he have one in this state, and if he have none, then to the
infant himself, if over fourteen years of age, or if under that age and
within this state, to the person with whom such infant resides.
3. If such infant is not a resident of this state, and his residence be
known, and that fact shall appear by affidavit to the satisfaction of the
court, and it shall further appear, that such infant has no general or
testamentary guardian in this state, the court may grant an order that
notice of an application for the appointment of a guardian for the
infant, be served upon such infant, if over fourteen years of age, by

chapter, shall be permitted to receive any money or property of the
ward, except costs and expenses allowed to the guardian, or recovered

4. Because there is a defect of parties.

murrer to the complaint; otherwise, it may be stricken out.
Section 2660. When any of the objections to a counterclaim mentioned
in section two thousand six hundred and fifty eight do not
appear upon the face of the answer, the objection may be taken by
reply. If not so taken, either by the demurrer or reply, the plaintitf

the party or his attoruey, and must be filed before the commencemerit

for trial. In case of a failure by either party to file any pleading on
his part, such pleading may be stricken out, on motion, unless per
mitted to be filed on such terms as the court shall think proper; or
the opposite party may file the copy thereof served on him.
Section 2665. When any pleading is verified, every subsequent
pleading, except a demurrer, must be verified also; but the verifica-
tion may be omitted when an admission of the allegations might subject
the party to prosecution for felony. And no pleading can be used
in a criminal prosecution against the party, as evidence of a fact ad
mitted or alleged in such pleading.
Section 2666. The verification must be to the effect that the same
is true to the knowledge of the person making it, except as to those
matters stated on information and belief, and as to those matters, he

there be several parties united in interest and pleading together, by
one, at least, of such parties acquainted with the facts, if such party
be within the county where the attorney resides, and capable of making
the affidavit. The affidavit may also be made by the agent or at-
torney, if the action or defense be founded upon a written instrument
for the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the
possession of the agent or attorney; or if all the material allegations
of the pleadings be within the personal knowledge of the agent or at
torney. When the pleading is verified by any other person than the
party, he shall set forth in the affidavit, his knowledge, or the grounds
of his belief on the subject, and the reasons why it is not made by the
party. When a corporation is a party, the verification may be made
by any officer thereof. And when the state, or any officer thereof in
its behalf, is a party, the verification may be made by any person
acquainted with the facts.
Section 2G67. Every material allegation of the complaint, not
controverted by the answer, as hereinbefore prescribed, and every ma-
terial allegation in a counterclaim not controverted by the reply, as
hereinbefore prescribed, shall, for the purposes of the action, be taken
as true. But the allegation of new matter in an answer not pleaded as
a part of a counterclaim, or of new matter in a reply, is to be deemed
controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct denial, or avoid
ance, as the case may require.
Section 2668. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose
o^ determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally construed,
w'tn a v*ew to substantial justice between the parties.
98 Wit. 158; :« id. 34.
Section 2669. No variance between the allegation in a pleading
and the proof shall be deemed material, unless it shall actually mis-
lead the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or
defense upon its merits. Whenever it shall be alleged that a party
has Deen 80 misled, that fact shall be proved to the satisfaction of th«
court, and in what respect he has been misled, and thereupon the
court may order the pleading to be amended upon such terms as may
be jugt
Section 2670. "When the variance is not material, as provided in
tjie ja8t 8ectjon) the court may direct the fact to be found in ac-
cordance with the evidence, or may order an amendment without
CO£t8.
88 Wis. 542; 40 id. 549,606.
Section 2671. When, however, the allegation of the cause of action,
counterclaim or defense to which the proof is directed is un-
proved, not in some particular or particulars only, but in its entire
scope and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of variance within
the last two sections, but a failure of proof.
Section 2672. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in
a pleading the items of an account therein alleged, but he shall deliver
to the adverse party, within ten days after a demand thereof in writ
ing, a copy of the account which, if the pleading is verified, must be
verified by his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, to the effect
that he believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving evidence
thereof. The court, or a judge thereof, or a county judge or court
commissioner, may order a further account when the one delivered is
defective; and the court may in all cases order a bill of particulars of
the claim of either party to be furnished,
Section 2673. In pleading a judgment or other determination of*
court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state
the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination
may be stated to have been duly given or maae. If such allegation
be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish on the
trial the facts conferring jurisdiction.
Section 2674. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent
.^ a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such
performance, but it may be stated generally that the party duly per-
formed all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be con
troverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish on the trial
the facts showing such performance,
Section 2675. In an action, defense or counterclaim, founded upon
an instrument for the payment of money only, it shall be sufiicienl
for the party to give a copy of the instrument, and to state that there
is dne to him thereon, from the adverse party, a specified sum which
he claims.

Section 2676. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived
therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer to 6iich statute by its title and
the day of its passage, and the court shall thereupon take judicial
notice thereof. In like manner, the statutes, acts and resolves of the
congress of the United States, and of the legislature of any state or
territory of the United States, published by authority of jthe respective
governments thereof, may be pleaded.
Section 26T7. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be
necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts, for the purpose
of showing the application to the plaintiff of the defamatory matters
out of which the cause of action arose; but it shall be sufficient to
state generally that the same was published or spoken concerning
the plaintiff, and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintif
shall be bound to establish on the trial that it was so published or
spoken.
Section 2678. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the
defendant may in his answer allege both the truth of the matter
charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to reduce
the amount of damages; and whether he prove the justification or not,
he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.
Section 2679. In an action to recover the possession of property
,....., . , J^ r , r r J
distrained doing damage, an answer that the defendant or person by
whose command he acted, was lawfully possessed of the real property
upon which the distress was made, and that the property distrained
was at the time doing damage thereon, shall be good without setting
forth the title to such real property.
Section 2680. In any action by husband and wife to recover dam-
ages for any injury to the person of the wife, sustained by or through
the act, procurement or negligence of the defendant, or for which the
defendant is liable, the plaintiff's may claim in the complaint, and
prove and recover, all the damages sustained by both, and which
might otherwise be recovered by separate actions.
Section 2681. If a demurrer, answer, or reply, be frivolous, the
court, or the judge thereof, may, upon motion, and five days' notice
to the party interposing the same, strike such pleading out, and
thereupon either order judgment in favor of the adverse party, or in
his discretion, allow the party interposing the same to plead over,
within a limited time, on such terms as may be just. If no further
pleading be served within the time so fixed, the adverse party may
obtain such judgment as he may be entitled to, in the manner provided
in case of a failure to answer or reply in the first instance.
24 Wis. 610; 27 id. 621 ; 38 id. 598; 37 id. 857; 40 Id. 555.
Section 26S2. A sham answer, reply or defense, whether by way of
, . , ., . , . 1 r J . .. j i
denial or avoidance, may be stricken out, on motion, and upon such
terms as the court or judge thereof may, in discretion, impose; but
no defense shall be deemed sham, the truth of which shall be sup
ported by the affidavit of a single witness, either by way of verifica
tion to the pleadings, or in opposing a motion to strike out.
Section 2083. If any pleading contain irrelevant, redundant or
scandalous matter, it may be stricken out, with costs, on motion of
the adverse party, and the conrt or judge, in discretion, may order the
attorney who signed the same, to pay the costs. When the allega-
tious of a pleading are so indefinite, or uncertain, that tbe precise
nature of the charge or defense is not apparent, the court may require
the pleading to be made definite and certain by amendment.

answer or reply, as sham, and frivolous, and irrelevant, and the court,
on such motion, may strike out any matter or defense as sham, any
other as frivolous, or as irrelevant or otherwise, as the pleading shall
be found to be.
Section 2685. Any pleading may be once amended by the party,
of course, without costs and without prejudice to the proceedings
already had, at any time before the period for answering it expires;
or *' can ^e 80 amended at any time within twenty days after the
service of the answer or demurrer to such pleading. In such case, a
copy of the amended pleading must be served on the adverse party.
But if it shall be made to appear to the court that such amendment
, _ . A S 1 it
was made for the purpose of delay, or that the same was unnecessary
and the opposite party will thereby lose the benefit of a term for which
tne action is or may be noticed, the amended pleading may be stricken
out and such terms imposed as to the court may seem just.

be just, order the action to be divided into as many actions as may be
necessary to the proper determination of the causes of action therein
mentioned.

which the party was ignorant when his former pleading was made.

amount of the judgment, with all costs, that may be recovered against
such defendant in the action, not exceeding the sum specified in the
undertaking, with interest. Such sum shall be at least double the
amount alleged to be due in the affidavit annexed to the writ, or, at

as a pleading is required to be, deny the existence, at the time of the
making of the affidavit annexed to the writ of attachment, of any or

of the action, the jury shall on the latter trial assess the damages sus
tained by the defendant by reason of the taking and detention, or sale,
of the property attached, or by reason of any injury thereto; and the
same, together with the costs so taxed, shall be applied by them as a
setoff to the plaintiff '6 demand, and if in excess of it, or the plaintiff
fail to recover, the verdict shall be for the defendant for the amount his
due. But if such trial be after the trial of the action, the court may
impanel a jury, or proceed itself, to assess such damages, and shall in
like manner apply the same when so assessed, with the costs so taxed,
as a setoff to the plaintiff's demand as established upon the trial, and
give judgment accordingly. If the court on the trial of such issue find
for the plaintiff, the presiding judge shall tax the plaintiff's costs of
such trial, and the amount so taxed shall, if he recover, be taxed by the
clerk as disbursements in the action; and if the defendant recover
judgment in the action, shall be applied toward payment thereof.

Section 2790. In an action arising on contract, thb defendant may,
wit'1 his answer, serve upon the plaintiff an offer in writing, that, if he

expenses incurred in consequence of any necessary preparations or
defense in respect to the question of damages; such expenses shall be
ascertained at the trial.

w is due to another party, the court may order the same to be deposited
in court, or delivered to such party, with or without security, subject to
the further direction of the court.
Section 2794. Whenever, in the exercise of its authority, a court

other property, and the order is disobeyed, the court, besides punishing
the disobedience as for contempt, may make an order requiring the

Section 2795. "When a judgment shall be recovered against one or
more of several persons, jointly indebted upon a contract, by proceed-
ing as provided in section two thousand eight hundred and eighty four,
those who were not originally summoned to answer the complaint may
be summoned to show cause why they should not be bound by the
judgment, in the same manner as if they had been originally sum
moned. The summons shall be subscribed by the judgment creditor,
his representatives or attorney, shall describe the judgment, and require
the person summoned to show cause, within twenty days after the
service of the summons, and shall be served in like manner as the origi
nal summons. The summons shall be accompanied by an affidavit of
the person subscribing it, that the judgment has not been satisfied to
his Knowledge, or information and belief, and specifying the amount
due thereon.
Section 279C. The party summoned may answer within the time
specified, and may make any defense which he might have originally
made to the action, and may deny the judgment, or make any defense
which may have arisen subsequently.
Section 2797. The party issuing the summons may demur or reply
to the answer, and the party summoned may demur to the reply, and
the issues may be tried and judgment may be given in the same man
ner as in an action and enforced oy execution, or the application of the
property charged to the payment of the judgment be compelled by
attachment, if necessary
Section 2793. The answer and reply shall be verified in the like
cases and manner, and be subject to the same rules as the answer and
reply in an action.
Section 2799. "When judgment shall have been entered in an action
against any defendant, upon whom service was attempted under an
order for publication of the summons, but whereby jurisdiction was
not acquired, such defendant may be summoned to show cause why he
should not be bound by the judgment in the same manner as if he had
been originally summoned. The summons shall be like that provided
in section two thousand seven hundred and ninety five, with a like
accompanying affidavit when the judgment is for a sum of money. It
may be served in any manner, as an original summons might be. Pro
ceedings thereon shall be had as prescribed in the three last preceding
sections, and judgment upon default, or otherwise, be entered, as the
nature of the case demands.
Section 2S00. An action does not abate by the occurrence of any
event, if the cause of action survives or continues.
Section 2801. In case of a transfer of interest, or devolution of
liability, the action may be continued by or against the original party,
or the court may direct the person to whom the interest is transferred.
or upon whom the liability is devolved, to be substituted in the action or
joined with the original party, as the case requires.
Section 2S02. When an action or special proceeding is lawfullj
brought by or in the name of a public officer, or by a receiver, or by
any trustee appointed by virtue of any statute, his death or removal
shall not abate the same, but it may be continued by his successor, who
may be substituted therefor by order of the court or a judge.
Seotion 2S03. In case of the death or other disability of a party,
if the cause of action survives or continues, the court, on motion, at
any time within one year thereafter, or afterwards, on a supplemental
complaint, may allow or compel the action to be continued bj or
against his representatives or successor in interest.
Section 2801. Where there are several plaintiffs or defendants in
any action, if any of them shall die, and the cause of action survives
to or against the others, the action may proceed, without interruption,
in favor of or against the survivors. If all the plaintiffs or defendants
shall die before judgment, the action may be prosecuted or defendel
by the executor or administrator of the last surviving plaintiff, or de-
fondant, as the c;ise may be. But the estate of a party jointly liable,
upon contract with others, shall not be discharged by his death, and
'he court may, by order, bring in the proper representative of the de
ceased defendant, when it is necessary so to do, for the proper dispo-
sition of the matter; and where the liability is several as well as joint,
may order a severance of the action, so that it may proceed separately
against the representative of the decedent, and against the surviving
defendants,
Section 2S05. In case of the death of any of several plaintiffs or
defendants, if part only of the cause of action, or part, or some of two
or more distinct causes of action, survives to or against the others, the
action may proceed without bringing in the successor to the rights or
liabilities of the deceased party, and the judgment shall not affect him
or his interest in the subject of the action. But when it appears proper
the court may require or compel the successor, or a person who claims
to be the successor, to be brought in as a party, upon his own applica
tion, or that of any party to the action.
Seotion 2806. In all actions for the recovery of real property, if
the plaintiff, or any of several plaintiffs, shall die before final judg-
ment, his heir, or his executor or administrator, for the benefit of the
heir or creditors may, within such time as the court shall allow, be ad
mitted to prosecute the action in his stead, with the same effect as if
the action had been so originally commenced,
Section 2807. If the interest of the deceased party passes to the
surviving plaintiffs, or if there be no motion for the admission of
another person as heir, executor or administrator, within the time
allowed by the court for that purpose, the surviving plaintiffs may
Erosecute the action for 60 much 01 the premises in question as may
e claimed by them,
Section 2S08. "When there are several defendants in any action for
the recovery of real property, and any of them shall die before final
judgment, the action may be prosecnted against the surviving defendants,
for so much of the premises as they shall hold or claim.
Section 2809. After an accepted offer to allow judgment to be taken,
or after a verdict, report of a referee, or finding by the court, in any
action, the action does not abate by the death of any party, but shall
be further proceeded with in the same manner as if the cause of action
survived by law; or the court may enter judgment in the names of the
original parties, if such offer, verdict, report or finding be not set aside.
But a verdict, report or finding, rendered against a party after his death,
is void.
Section 2810. Whenever any person shall be entitled to revive or
continue any action or proceeding, interrupted by the occurrence of
death, removal from a trust, or other disability, he may make and file
with the clerk a supplemental complaint, affidavit or petition, as the
action or proceeding may be, and thereupon a notice to the other party
or his proper representative, of the time and place of such filing, and
that unless he shows cause, if any he have, by answer or afhdavit,
within twenty days after service of such notice on him, exclusive of the
day of service, why such action or proceeding should not be revived or
continued, the same will stand revived or continued, according to such
supplemental complaint, petition or affidavit. Such notice shall be
subscribed by the party or his attorney, and be served in the same man
ner as a summons, and service thereof without the state, or by publica
tion, may be ordered in the same cases, and in like manner. Upon filing
such notice, with proof of service, and that no answer or afhdavit has
been received, the court, or a judge, shall make an order that the action
or proceeding stand revived or continued, accordingly. An answer, or
affidavit, showing cause against such revivor or continuance may be
served on the party subscribing such notice within the time specified, as
a pleading is served ; and, thereupon, the court shall make such order
as the circumstances may require.
Section 2S11. At any time after the death of the plaintiff, or after
the plaintiff's marriage, where it affects the rights of either party, the
court may, in its discretion, upon notice to such persons as it shall
direct, and on the application of the adverse party, or of a person whose
interest is affected, make an order that the action be dismissed, unless
continued by the proper parties, within a time to be therein specified,
not less than three months after the making thereof; and unless so con
tinued within such time, the same shall stand dismissed thereby, with
out further order.

wise expressly directed in particular instances, a county judge or court
commissioner may exercise within his county the powers, and shall be

the court.
Section 2S16. Where a motion, whether on notice or order to show
cause, is made to be heard before the court or the presiding judge

party, or is interested, the motion may be transferred by his order, on
the request of either party, or his own motion, to some other circuit
court, or to a court having concurrent jurisdiction of the subject of
the action, to be designated by him, or it may be so transferred by the
written stipulation of the parties. The court so designated shall hear
and decide the motion, and make the proper orders for the determina
tion thereof and carrying the same into execution, which shall be
entered in the clerk's office of the county where the action is pending,
and have the same effect as if made by the court from which it was
transferred.
Section 2S17. When a notice of motion is necessary, unless the

made.
CHAPTER CXXVIII.
OF ISSUES, TRIALS AND JUDGMENTS.
Section 2837. Issues arise npon the pleadings when a fact or conelusion
of law is maintained by one party and controverted by the
other; they are of two kinds:
1. Of law.
2. Of fact.
Section 2838. An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to the complaint,
answer or reply, or to some part thereof.
Section 2839. An issue of fact arises:
1. Upon a material allegation in the complaint, controverted by the
answer; or
2. Upon a material allegation of any counterclaim in the answer,
controverted by the reply; or
3. Upon a material allegation of new matter, in the answer, not re
quiring a reply, unless an issue of law is joined thereon; or
4. Upon a material allegation of new matter in the reply, unless an
issue of law is joined thereon.
Section 2840. Issues, both of law and of fact, may arise upon dif-
ferent parts of the pleadings in the same action; in such cases the issue
of law must be first tried, unless the court otherwise direct.
Section 2841. Feigned issues have been abolished, and instead
thereof, in the case where the power formerly existed to order a feigned
issue, or when a question of fact not put in issue by the pleadings is
to be tried by a jury, an order for trial may be made, stating distinctly
and plainly the question of fact to be tried, and such order shall be the
only authority necessary for a trial.
Section 2842. A trial is the judicial examination of the issues between
the parties, whether they be issues of law or of fact.
Section 2843. An issue of law is triable by the court. An issue
of fact in an action for the recovery of money only, or of specific real
or personal property, or for a divorce on the ground of adultery, must
be tried by a jury, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and
except that all issues arising on equitable defenses or counterclaims are
triable by the court. Every other issue must be tried by the court,
which, however, may order the whole issue or any specific question of
fact involved therein to be tried by a jury; or may refer an issue as
hereinafter provided.
Section 2S44. When in any action there shall arise issues triable
by a jury and other issues triable by the court, the court shall, in its
discretion, direct the trial of the one or the other to be first had, according
to the nature of the issues and the interests of justice, and
judgment shall be given upon both the verdict and the finding of the
court, when both shall be round. But no issue need be tried, the dis
position of which is not necessary to enable the court to render the
appropriate judgment. A separate trial between the plaintiff and any
of the several defendants may be allowed by the court, whenever in its
opinion justice will be thereby promoted.
NOTICE OF TRIAL, AND CALENDAR.
Section 2845. Notice of trial of any civil action, including all
actions pending on appeal, at any term of court at which the same is
triable, may be given after issue joined therein, by either party to the
other at lea^t ten days before such term. After notice by cither party,
a note of issue, containing the title of the cause, the names of the
attorneys respectively, the time when issue was joined, and briefly stat
ing whether the issue be an issue of law or of fact, and if the latter,
whether triable by the court or by jury, may be filed by either party
at least eight days before the term, and the clerk shall thereupon place
the action on the calendar; or if such note of issue be not filed, the
court may in its discretion direct the action when so noticed for trial
to be placed on the calendar for the term,
Section 2846. The clerk shall prepare a calendar for each term of
the circuit court, of all actions in which such notes of issue have been
so filed, containing the title of each such action, the names of the attor
neys, and the date of the issue, and arranged according to the dates cf
issue, in three classes:
1. Issues of fact to be tried by a jury.
2. Issues of fact to be tried by the court.
3. Issues of law.
In which order the calendar shall be disposed of, unless for conven
ience of parties, the dispatch of business, or the prevention of injustice,
the court shall otherwise direct. In all actions pending on appeal, the
date of filing the return on appeal shall be deemed the date of issue.
Section 2847. Either party may bring all the issues in an action to
trial, at any term at which the same are triable, when a notice of trial
has been duly served by either, and unless the court for good cause
otherwise direct, may, in the absence of the adverse party, proceed with
his case and take a dismissal of the action, or a verdict or judgment, as
the case may require. No inquest shall hereafter be taken in any
action.
Section 2S48. When, in any action noticed for trial, there shall be
,. , . it • .i . «
pending a demurrer to any pleading, or a morion to strike out a plead;n^
01. anv pfirt thereof, or to make it more definite and certain, and
the court shall think any such proceeding by either party may have
been taken for delay, or that for any reason justice requires a more
speedy disposition of the action, the demurrer or motion may be dis
posed of at the commencement of the term, and the action be tried at
the same term, short leave to amend or plead over being given when
necessary; and a continuance be granted only upon good cause shown,
which the court may in discretion require to be such as is usually re
quired to obtain a second continuance in other actions.
Section 2849 The court shall, on request of either party, examine
on oath, any person who is called as a juror therein, to know whether
he is related to either party, or has any interest in the cause, or has ex
pressed or formed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice
therein, and the party objecting to the juror may introduce any other
competent evidence in support of the objection, and if it shall appear
■» the court that the juror does not stand indifferent in the cause
another shall be called and placed in his stead for trial of that cause.
Section 2S50. It shall oe no cause of challenge to a juror, that he
may have obtained information of the matters at issue through news-
Sapers or public journals, if he shall have received no bias or prejuice
thereby; or that he is an inhabitant of or liable to pay taxes in a
county interested in the action.
Section 2851. Each party shall be entitled to three peremptory
challenges from a full panel of jurors called in the action. The challenges
shall be made alternately by the part fes, one at a time, the plaint-
iff beginning; and when either party shall decline to challenge in his
turn, he shall be deemed to have waived each time one challenge.
Section 2852. The fury may, in any case, at the request of either
, . , • A • 1 • j.-
party, be taken to view the premises or place in question, or any prop
erty, matter or thing, relating to the controversy between the parties,
when it shall appear to the court that such view is necessary to a just
decision: provided, the party making the motion shall advance a sum
sufficient to defray the expenses of the jury and the officers who attend
them in taking the view; which expenses shall afterwards be taxed like
other legal costs, if the party who advanced them shall prevail in the
action.
Section 2S53. Upon the trial of every action, the judge presiding
shall, before giving the same to the jury, reduce to writing and give asw
written his charge and instructions to the jury, and all further and par
ticular instructions given them when they shall return after having
once retired to deliberate, unless a written charge be waived by counsel
it the commencement of the trial; and except that the charge or in-
rtructions may be delivered orally when taken down by the official pho
nographic reporter of the court. Each instruction asked by counsel to
t>e given the jury, shall be given without change or modification the
*ame as asked, or refused in full. If any judge shall violate any of the
foregoing provisions, or make any comments to the jury upon the law
er facts on the trial, in any action, without the same being so reduced
to writing or taken down, the judgment rendered upon the verdict
found on such trial shall be reversed upon appeal or writ of error upon
the fact appearing. The judge shall require the phonographic reporter
to take down all that he may say during any jury trial to the jury, or
to counsel in their presence, of or concerning such cause.
Section 285-t. As soon as any such charge shall have been given,
the same shall be placed and remain on file among the records and
papers of the case in which it was given. When delivered orally and
taken down by the reporter, he shall immediately transcribe the same
in long hand, and file the transcribed copy, without special compensa
tion therefor.

, i, •'.•'' .,, . , . ° 1
upon any cause, 6hiill return into court without having agreed on aj
verdict, the court may state anew the evidence, or any part of it, and
may explain to them anew the law applicable to the case, and may send
them out again for further deliberation; but, if they shall return a sec-
ond time without having agreed on a verdict, they shall not be sent out
again without their own consent, unless they shall ask from the court
some further explanation of the law.
Section 2856. The plaintiff shall have no right to submit to a non-
suit after the argument of the cause to the jury upon the testimony
shall have been concluded or waived.
Section 2857. A general verdict is one by which the jury pronounce

discretion, direct the jury to render a verdict subject to the opinion of
the court.

Section 2858. The court, in its discretion, may, and when either
party, at or before the close of the testimony and before any argument
to the jury is made or waived, shall so request, the court shall direct
tiie jur.v to fin^ a special verdict. Such verdict shall be prepared by
tue court in the form of questions, in writing, relating only to material
issues of fact and admitting a direct answer, to which the jury shall
make answer in writing. The court may also direct the jury, if they
render a general verdict, to find in writing upon any particular ques
tions of fact, to be stated as aforesaid. In every action for the recovery
of money only, or specific real property, the jury may, in their discre
tion, when not otherwise directed by the court, render a general or a
special verdict,
Section 2859. When a verdict is found for the plaintiff in an
action for the recovery of money, or for the defendant when a counter
claim is established beyond the amount of the plaintiff's claim as estab
lished, the jury must assess the amount of the recovery. The jury
may also, under the direction of the court, assess the amount of the
damages, where the court orders any judgment on the pleadings for
either party. In an action of replevin, if the property have not been
delivered to the plaintiff, or the defendant by his answer claim »
return thereof, the jury shall assess the value of the property, if their
verdict be in favor of the plaintiff, or if they find in favor of tie
defendant that he is entitled to a return thereof, and may at the same
time assess the damages, if they are claimed in the complaint, or
answer, which the prevailing party has sustained by reacon of the
detention, or taking and withholding such property,
Section 2860. Every verdict and special finding of facts shall be
"entered on the minutes and when in writing be filed with the clerk.
When a special finding of facts shall be inconsistent with the general
verdict, the former shall control the latter, and the court shall give
judgment accordingly.
Section 2861. Upon receiving a verdict, the clerk shall make an
entry on his minutes, specifying the time and place of the trial, the
names of the jurors and witnesses, the verdict, and either the judgment
rendered thereon, or an order that the cause be reserved for argument
or further consideration. If a different direction be not given by the
court, the clerk must enter judgment in conformity with the verdict.
If a counterclaim, established at the trial, exceed the plaintiff's demand
60 established, judgment for the defendant must be given for the excess;
or if it appears that the defendant is entitled to any other affirmative,
relief, judgment must be given accordingly.
Section 2862. Trial by jury may be waived by the several parties
to an issue of fact in actions on contract, and with the assent of the
court in other actions, in the following manner:
„ , i .i°
1. By failing to appear at the trial.
2. By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed with the clerk.
3. By oral consent in open court, entered in the minutes.
Section 2863. Upon a trial of a question of fact by the court, its
decision shall be given in writing, and filed with the clerk within
twentv davs after the court at which the trial took place. Judjnnent
upon the decision shall be entered accordingly, as of the term at
■which the cause was tried, and the judge shall state in his decision

Section 2864. All or any of the issuss in the action, whether of fact
or of law, or both, may be referred, in the discretion of the court, upon
the written consent of the parties. When the parties do not consent to
the reference, the court may, upon the application of either party, or of
its own motion, direct a reference in the following cases:
1. When the trial of an issue of fact shall require the examination of
a long account on either side; in which case the referee may be directed
to hear and decide the whole issue, or to report upon any specific ques
tion of fact involved therein; or
2. When the taking of an account shall be necessary for the informa
tion of the court, before judgment, or for carrying a judgment or order
into effect; or
3. When a question of fact, other than upon the pleading, shall arise
upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of the action.
Section 2865. The trial by referees shall be conducted in the same
manner as a trial by the court. They shall have the same power to

court upon such trial, upon the same terms and with the like effect.
They shall also have the same power to preserve order, and punish all
violations thereof, upon such trial, and to compel the attendance of
witnesses before them by attachment, and to punish them as for a con

sessed by the court; and they shall give to the parties or their attorneys,
at least eight days' notice of the time and place of trial; they must state
the facts found and conclusions of law separately, and report their
findings, together with all the evidence taken by them, and all excep-

may review such report, and, on motion, enter judgment thereon, or^
set aside, alter or modify the same, and enter judgment upon the same
so altered or modified, and may require the referees to amend their
report, when necessary. The judgment so entered by the circuit
court may be appealed from to the supreme court, in like manner as
from judgments in other cases, and the report of the referees may
be incorporated with the bill of exceptions. When the reference is to
report the facts, the report shall have the effect of a special verdict.
Section 2S66. In all cases of reference, the parties, except when an
infant may be a party, may agree upon a suitable person or persons, not
exceeding three, and the reference shall be ordered accordingly, and, if
the parties do not agree, the court shall appoint one or more referee,
not exceeding three, who shall be free from exception.
Section 2867. If in any action heard and decided by a referee, tha
prevailing party shall fail to cause the referee's report to be filed sd
move for a judgment thereon within one year from the date of wj
report, the action shall be dismissed, or a new trial ordered, on mon'oi
of the adverse party: provided, s;.-ch motion nhall not be made until is
least, two terms of court shall have been held subsequent to the daa
of such report.
Section 2S6S. Every referee, appointed for any purpose, before :
after judgment, in any action or special proceeding, by any court I

amages recovered thereby. This section does not apply to actions
regulated by chapter forty four,
Section 2S91. Judgment may be had if the defendant fail to answer
^ ^p]^,^ as f0Hows:
1. In any action arising on contract for the recovery of money only,

proof of personal service of the summons on one or more of the defendants,
and that no answer or demurrer has been received, or if any such
nas Deen received, that the same has been struck out by order of the
oourt or a judge, and tnat no other answer or demurrer has been
received, and the time granted by any order therefor has expired. If
the complaint be duly verified, the clerk shall thereupon enter judg-
ment for the amount demanded in the complaint against such defend-
, # 1 • * 1 ° 1 3 (• 1 •
ant or defendants, or against one or more of the several defendants in
the cases provided for in section two thousand eight hundred and
eighty four. But if the complaint be not duly verified, and such action
is on an instrument for the payment of money only, the clerk, on its
production to him, shall assess the amount due to the plaintiff thereon;
and in other cases shall ascertain and assess the amount which the
plaintiff is entitled to recover in the action from his examination under
oath, or other proof, and enter the judgment for the amount so assessed.
In case the defendant shall have appeared in the action, he shall be
entitled to five days' notice of the time and place of such assess
ment,
2. In other actions, the plaintiff may, upon the like proof, apply to
the court for judgment, according to the demand of the complaint If
the taking an account or the proof of any fact be necessary to enable
the court to give judgment, or to carry the judgment into effect, the
plaintiff may, with a view to such application, at any time after the
expiration of the time for answering, have an order of reference, by the
court or a judge, to take such account or proofs and report the same to
the court at any time, in the circuit, at which judgment may be ren
dered, and such reference may be executed in any county most con
venient therefor; or upon such application being made, the court may
take the account,' or hear the proof, or in its discretion order a refer
ence for that purpose. And when the action is for the recovery of
money only, or of specific real or personal property, with damages for

by a jury. If the defendant shall have appeared in the action, he shall
be entitled to eight clays' notice of such application for judgment,
3. In actions where the service of the summons was made without
the state, or by publication, proof shall be made, as aforesaid, of the
demand mentioned in the complaint; and in case the defendant is a non
resident, the plaintiff or his agent shall be examined on oath as to any
tiayment that may have been made to such plaintiff, or to any one for
lis use on account of such demand, and the court may render judg
ment for the amount which he is entitled to recover; and before enter
ing judgment the court may in its discretion require the plaintiff to
cause to be tiled satisfactory security to abide the order of the court
touching the restitution of any estate or effects which may be directed
by such judgment to be transferred or delivered, or the restitution of
any money that may be collected under or by virtue of such judgment,
in case tlie defendant or his representatives shall apply and be admitted
to defend the action, and shall succeed in such defense.
Section 2892. In an action arising on a contract for the recovery
of money only, if the answer of the defendant, either expressly or by
not denying, admits any part of the plaintiff's claim to be just, or if
such answer sets up a counterclaim or setoff for an amount less than
the plaintiffs claim, and contains no other defense to the action, the
clerk, on the application of the plaintiff, shall enter judgment for the
amount so admitted, or for the amount claimed in the complaint, after
deducting the amount of the defendant's counterclaim or setoff; notice
of such application shall be given to the defendant at least five days
before the same is made. When the answer of the defendant in any
case, expressly, or by not denying, admits part of the plaintiffs claim
to be just, the court may on motion order such defendant to satisfy
that part of the claim, and may enforce the order as it enforces a judg
ment or provisional remedy.
Section 2893. When the plaintiff is entitled to judgment after trial
npon an issue of law, he may proceed in the manner prescribed in sec-
tion two thousand eight hundred and ninety one, upon the failure of
the defendant to answer, where the summons was personally served, or

such trial. If the defendant be entitled to judgment after a like trial,
he may proceed according to such order therefor as may have been like
wise made; or, if none, he may apply to the court therefor, and there
upon the court may take any account, or hear proof, or order a refer
ence, or an assessment of damages by a jury, when necessary to enable
the court to complete the judgment, as may be done on application of
the plaintiff under the section aforesaid.
Section 2894. Judgmeut upon trial of an issue of fact by the court,

warrant of attorney, may be rendered without action, either for money
due, or to become due, or to secure any person against contingent liability
on behalf of the defendant, or both, in the manner prescribed in
the next section.

Section 2896. The plaintiff shall file with his complaint an answer,
signed by the defendant, or some attorney in his behalf, confessing the
amount claimed in the complaint, or some part thereof, and in case such
answer is signed by an attorney, an instrument authorizing judgment
to be confessed, or entered, shall be produced to the court, or judge
signing the judgment, and shall be made a part of the judgment roll.

complaint an affidavit, stating the" amount due or to become due on the
note or bond, or if such note or bond is given to secure any contingent
liability, the affidavit must state concisely the facts constituting such
liability, and must show that the sum confessed does not exceed the
same. 'No other affidavit shall be necessary, although more than a year

than ten dollars, exclusive of costs, rendered by any justice of the
peace in his county, forthwith file the same, and docket such judg

preceding section. When the transcript shall show that execution was
staved in the justice's court, with the name of the surety therefor, th*
clerk shall docket the judgment against such surety, as well as tie
judgment debtor, and such surety shall be bound thereby as a judg
ment debtor, and his property be subject to lien and be liable thereoi.
to the same extent as his principal. Every such judgment, from the
time of such filing of the transcript thereof, shall be deemed the judg
ment of the circuit court, be equally under the control thereof, and be
carried into execution, both as to the principal judgment debtor and
his surety, if any, in the same manner and with like effect as the judg
ments thereof, except that no action can be brought upon the same as a
judgment of such court, nor execution issued thereon after the expira
tion of the period of the lien thereof on real estate provided by section
two thousand nine hundred and two.
Section 2901. "When a judgment shall have been docketed as provided
in the two preceding sections, it may be docketed in the like
manner in any other county, upon tiling with the clerk of the circuit
court thereof a transcript of the original docket, certified by the clerk
of the circuit court having custody thereof.
Section 29<~>2. Every such judgment, when so docketed, shall, for
a period expiring ten years from the date of the rendition thereof,
be a lien on the real property in the county where the same is dock-
eted, except the homestead mentioned in section two thousand nine
hundred and eighty three, of every person against whom such judg-
merit shall be rendered and docketed, and which he may have at the
time of docketing thereof in the county in which such real estate is sit-
nated, or which he shall acquire at any time thereafter within said
period of ten years. But when the collection of the judgment or the
sale of the real estate upon which the same may be a lien, shall be de
layed or prohibited by any injunction or other order or otherwise, by
law, and the judgment creditor shall have caused to be entered on the
docket, "enforcement suspended by injunction," or otherwise, as the
case may be, with the date of such entry affixed, the time of such delay
or prohibition after the date of such entry shall not be taken or counted
as any part of the said period of ten years. And whenever an appeal
from any judgment shall be pending, and duly perfected, and the un
dertaking requisite to stay execution thereon shall have been given, the
court in which such judgment was recovered may, on special motion,
after notice to the owner of such judgment, on such terms as it shall
see fit, direct an entry to be made by the clerk, on the docket of such
judgment, that the same is " secured on appeal," and thereupon it shall
cease during the pendency of such appeal to be a lien on the real prop
erty of the judgment debtor, as against purchasers and mortgagees in
good faith. Whenever such judgment shall lie affirmed on such appeal,
or the appeal dismissed, the clerk shall on the tiling of the remittitur
or judgment of affirmance or of dismissal of the appeal, enter on the
docket " lien restored by affirmance," or " lien restored by dismissal of
appeal," with the date of such entry, and the lien thereof shall be there
upon restored accordingly. Similar entries may be made with the like
effect upon the docket of such judgment in any other county, upon
filing with the clerk of the circuit court thereof a transcript of the docket
of the county in which the same was so first docketed.

shall be filed with the clerk, he shall note the fact and the date thereof
and of filing on the docket. An assignment may also bo made by a
brief entry on the docket thus: " I assign this judgment to A. B,"

case, and shall also enter a brief statement of the substance thereof, in
cluding, the amount paid, on the margin of the judgment docket, with
the date of filing the satisfaction,
Section 2911. When a judgment shall have been fully paid and
satisfied, or the instrument of satisfaction shall have been lost, the
court in which the same was recovered, may upon satisfactory proof,
authorize the attorney of the judgment creditor to satisfy the same, or
may by order declare the same satisfied, and direct satifaction to be
entered upon the docket,
Section 2912. When a judgment shall have been satisfied, in whole
in part, or as to any judgment debtor, and such satisfaction entered
upon the docket, as aforesaid, such judgment shall, to the extent of such

Section- 3021. When lands and tenements in the hands of several
persons shall be liable to satisfy any judgment, and the whole of snch

thereof to him. A copy of such petition, with a notice of the time
and place wdien and where the same will be presented, must be served
upon the person against whom the writ is prayed for, at least ten days
before the same is presented; such petition may be served as a sum

direct such writ to issue, and the same shall be executed and return
made in like manner as upon a sale made upon a judgment for fore

Section 3028. After the issuing of execution against property, any
person indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the sheriff the
amount of his debt, or so much thereof as shall be necessaiy to satisfy
the execution, and the sheriffs receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for
the amount so paid. . ^
Section 3029. Whenever any execution against the property of any
judgment debtor shall have been issued upon a judgment for the pajment
of money, and shall have been returned unsatisfied, in whole or
in part, the judgment creditor may commence an action against sncl
judgment debtor, and any other person, to compel the discovery of any
property or thing in action, belonging to such judgment debtor, and of
any property, money or thing in action due or held in trust for him,
S £ r J ' ,-, » » H i . ..i ^i •
and to prevent the transfer of any such property, money or other thing
action, or the payment or delivery thereof to such judgment debtor,
except where such trust has been created by, or the fund so held in
trust has proceeded from, some person other than the defendant himself.
Section 3030. When an execution against property of the judgment
debtor, or of any one of several debtors in the same judgment,
issued to tne sheriff of the county where he resides, or if he do not reside
in the state, to the sheriff of a county where a judgment roll or
transcript of a justice's judgment is filed, is returned unsatisfied, in
whole or in part, the judgment creditor, at any time after such return
is made, is entitled to an order from the judge of the court, or a county
judge or court commissioner of the county to which the execution was
issued, requiring such judgment debtor to appear before him and ai-
swer concerning his property, at a time and place, specified in the order.

an^ before the return thereof, upon proof by affidavit, to the satisfac-
tjon 0f a judge of the court, or a county judge or court commissioner
of the county to which the execution was issued, that any judgment
debtor residing in the county where such judge resides, has property
which he unjustly refuses to apply towards the satisfaction of the judg
ment, such judge may make an order requiring the judgment debtor to
appear at a specified time and place to answer concerning the same.
Section 3032. Instead of making an order requiring the attendance
oi the judgment debtor, as provided in the two preceding sections, the
judge, upon proof, by affidavit to his satisfaction, that there is danger
of the judgment debtor's leaving the state or concealing himself, and
that there is reason to believe that he has property which he unjustly
refuses to apply to such judgment, may issue a warrant requiring the
sheriff of any county where such debtor may be, to arrest him and
bring him before such judge, to answer concerning his property.
Section 3033. Upon his appearing or being brought before the
such judgment debtor may be examined on oath, and witnesses
may be required to appeal- and testify on the part of either party, in
the same manner as upon the trial of an issue. The judge, in his
discretion, may appoint a referee to take and report such examinations,
and require the judgment debtor and witnesses, or any of them, to attend
and be examined before him. No person shall, on such examination,
be excused from answering any question on the ground that his exam
ination or answer will tend to convict him of the commission of a fraud,
but his answer shall not be used as evidence against him in any criminal
action or proceeding.
Section 3034. If it shall appear upon or pending any such examination,
that there is danger of the debtor's leaving the state, and that
he has property which he has unjustly refused to apply to such judg
ment, he may be ordered to enter into an undertaking, with one or more
sureties, that he will from time to time attend before the judge as he
shall direct, and that he will not, during the pendency of the proceed
ings, dispose of any portion of his property not exempt from execu
tion. In default of entering into such undertaking, he may be com
mitted to prison, by warrant of the judge, as for a contempt.
Section 3035. The judge may order any property of the judgment
debtor in the hands either of himself or any other person, or due to
the judgment debtor, not exempt from execution, to be applied toward
the satisfaction of the judgment; but if it appear that any person.
alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or to be indebted to
him, claims an interest in the property adverse to him, or denies the
debt, such interest or debt shall be recoverable only in an action
against such person by the receiver; but the judge may by order for
bid a transfer or other disposition of such property, or interest, till a
sufficient opportunity be given to the receiver to commence the action
and prosecute the same to judgment and execution, and may modify or
dissolve such order at any time, on such security as he shall direct.
Section 3036. Before appointing any receiver, the judge shall ascertain,
if practicable, by oath of the party or otherwise, whether anyc
other supplementary proceedings are pending against the judgment
debtor, and if there be any, the plaintiff therein shall have notice to
appear before him, and shall likewise have notice of all subsequent
proceedings in relation to such receivership, and no more than one such
receiver shall be appointed. The judge may also, at any time, by order,
forbid any transfer or other disposition of, or interference with, the
property of the judgment debtor, not exempt from execution.
Section 3037. If any person, partv or witness, shall disobey an order
of the judge or referee, duly served, "he may be punished by the judge
as for a contempt; and in all cases of commitment under this chapter,
the person committed may, in case of inability to perform the act required
or to endure the imprisonment, be discharged by the judge com-
mitting him, or the court in which the judgment was rendered, on such
terms as may be just.
Section 3038. The judge may allow to the judgment creditor, or to
any party so examined, whether a party to the action or not, witness
fees and disbursements, and a fixed sum in addition, not exceeding
twenty five dollars, as costs, and require their payment by order.

the supreme court on the appeal, the circuit court may, after the
remittitur of the record from the supreme court is filed, order a reference
to ascertain such damages, the expense of which shall be included
and recoverable with such damages. In all cases, a neglect for the
space of thirty days after the affirmance on appeal of a judgment
directing the payment of money, to pay the amount directed to be paid
on such affirmance, shall be deemed a breach of the undertaking on such
appeal. A neglect, for the space of thirty days after the confirmation
of the report of a referee, to whom a reference has been ordered for the
purpose of ascertaining the damages to be paid, on the affirmance of
any other judgment or order appealed from, to pay the amount of dam
ages so ascertained, and the costs of such reference, shall be deemed a
breach of the undertaking on such appeal. The dismissal of an appeal
or writ of error by the appellant or plaintiff in error, or by the court
for want of prosecution, unless the court shall, at the time, otherwise
expressly order, shall render the sureties upon any undertaking or bond,
given under this chapter, liable in the same manner, and to the same
extent, as if the judgment or order appealed from, or the judgment
brought up on error, had been affirmed.
Section 3068. "When a party shall in good faith give notice of
appeal, and shall omit, through mistake or accident, to do any other act
necessary to perfect the appeal or make it effectual, or to stay proceedings,

thereof, or the supreme court, or one of the justices thereof, may permit
an amendment, or the proper act to be done, on such terms as may
be just.

Section 3096. In every case where a recovery shall be had of any
land, on which the party in possession, or those under whom he claims,
while holding adversely by color of title asserted in good faith, founded
on descent or any written instrument, shall have made permanent and
valuable improvements, or shall have paid taxes assessed, such party,
for liimself and for the benefit of those under whom he claims, shall
be entitled to have from the plaintiff, his heirs or assigns, if he insist
upon his recovery, the value of such improvements at the time the ver-
diet or decision against him is given, and the amount paid for taxes,
with interest from the date of the payment, to be assessed and recov
ered as hereinafter provided, and for the payment thereof shall have a
lien on the real estate so recovered. When such recovery is of- any es
tate less than a fee, or of any share or interest less than the whole, the
claim for such improvements and taxes shall be proportioned to the
benefits derived thereby to the estate, share or interest recovered. But
the plaintiff shall be entitled to set off against such claim for improve
ments and taxes, any claim for rents and profits ci joyed by the de
fendant, or those under whom he claims, during any period occurring
prior to and terminating six years before the commencement of such
action of ejectment, and which he might have recovered but for the
limitation by law thereon; and also any such rents and profits, enjoyed
by the defendant since the verdict in the ejectment action and prior to
the assessment of the value of such improvements.
Section 3097. Such claim for improvements and taxes may be tried,
and the amount exceeding the setoffs aforesaid, assessed and recovered
as follows:
1. The defendant may set forth his claims by way of counterclaim
in his answer to the complaint in ejectment, and have the same tried
and the amount assessed by the same jury by which the action of eject
ment is tried, but a separate verdict shall, in all cases, be rendered
thereon; or
2. After a verdict for the plaintiff, and at the same term, or within
such further time as may be granted by the court, when no such coun
terclaim shall have been made, the court shall, on the application of
the defendant, cause an issue to be made up between the parties, in
which such defendant shall be plaintiff and the plaintiff in the eject
ment action shall be defendant, and such issue shall stand for trial by
a jury at the same or any subsequent term to which it shall be con
tinued; in which case no judgment shall be entered in the action of
ejectment until the trial of such issue.
3. If neither of the foregoing modes be pursued, the defendant may
recover such taxes and interest, and the value of such improvements,
with interest from the date of the verdict in the ejectment action, and
enforce his lien therefor, by an independent action after judgment in
the ejectment action, which must be commenced within one year from
the date of the execution of such judgment. Such action may be
maintained in the circuit court, notwithstanding the action of ejectment
may have been tried in any court of the United States.
Section 3098. When the right of a defendant to recover for such
. _ 1 11 i ii*iiii
improvements and taxes shall be established, and the amount thereof
assessed in either of the two first modes aforesaid, such assessment, with
the costs of the trial of such issue, shall be set off against the sum
awarded for costs and damages to the plaintiff in the action of eject-
ment, and if there remain any excess, the judgment in such action shall
provide that the plaintiff shall pay the amount thereof, with interest
from the date of the verdict in the ejectment action, within three years
from the date of such assessment, as a condition of execution, and shall
have no claim for rents and profits while the same remains so unpaid
after assessment, and that, in default of such payment, he shall be
deemed to have abandoned his claim of title to the premises in ques
tion, and, together with all persons claiming under him, shall be for
ever barred of a recovery, and of claim ot title, and the title to the
premises in question shall be deemed absolutely vested in the defend
ant, and the defendant shall recover his costs of any separate trial of
the value of such improvements; but that upon payment as aforesaid,
the plaintiff shall have execution for the premises recovered.
Section 3099. At the expiration of the three years limited in any
such judgment, the court may make an order upon the foot of the
judgment, upon application of the defendant, after notice and upon
satisfactory proof of the fact, declaring that the plaintiff hai failed to
make the payment required thereby as a condition of execution, and
that the judgment has become absolute in favor of the defendant,
Section 3100. If the defendant in any action of ejectment be, at
the time of the rendition thereof, under either disability mentioned in
section three thousand and ninety, the time during which such disabil-
itj shall continue, shall not be reckoned any part of the year mentioned
in the third subdivision of section three thousand and ninety seven:
but the action may be brought within one year after the removal or
such disability.
CHAPTER CXXXIV.
OF ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS FOR PARTITION.
Section 3101. All persons holding lands as joint tenants, or tenants
in common, may have partition thereof by civil action in the manner
provided in this chapter. Such action may be maintained by any per-
son who has any estate in possession of the lauds of which partition
is sought, but not by any one who has only an estate therein in remain
der or reversion.
Section 3102. The complaint in such action shall particularly de-
scribe the lands sought to be partitioned, and shall set forth the rights
and titles of all persons interested therein, so far as the same are known
to the plaintiff, including the interest of any tenant for years, for life,
by the curtesy or in dower, and of the persons entitled to the rever
sion, remainder, or inheritance, after the termination of any particular
estate therein; and of every person, who by any contingency, contained
in any devise, grant or otherwise, or as having an inchoate right of
dower, may be or become entitled to any beneficial interest in the
1>remi6es; but in case any such person, or his share, or interest, be un
known to the plaintiff, or be uncertain or contingent, or the ownership
of the inheritance shall depend upon an executory devise, or the remain
der shall be a contingent remainder, so that such person, or his interest,
cannot be named or set forth, the same shall be stated in the complaint,
bat no person, whose title or interest appears of record, or who is in
the actual possession or occupancy of any of such lands, shall be con
sidered or proceeded against as an unknown owner. The complaint
shall demand judgment for a partition of the premises according to
the respective rights of the parties interested therein, and for a sale
thereof, if it shall appear that partition of the land cannot be made
without great prejudice to the owners thereof; and when the complaint
does not pray partition of all the lands owned by the parties, either of
them may have the complaint so amended as to affect all the lands so
owned. Every person having an interest, as aforesaid, whether in
possession or otherwise, and every person entitled to dower in such
premises, if the same has not been admeasured, may be made a party
to such action.
Section 3103. The plaintiff need not in the first instance, but may,
at his election, make any creditor having a lien upon the premises, or
any part thereof, or any undivided interest or estate therein, a defend
ant. If such lien is upon an individual interest or estate therein, the
complaint shall set forth the nature of such lien, and specify the share
to which it attaches. If partition is made, such lien upon an undivided
interest or estate shall thereafter be a charge only on the share assigned
to the party against whom it exists, which share shall be charged with
its just proportion of the costs in preference to such lien, but in no
other case shall such partition alter, affect or impair the lien of any
such creditor.
Section 3104. The general guardians residing in this state of all
minors, or other persons under guardianship, who should be parties to
any such action, upon giving the bond herein provided shall represent
their wards therein; and the court shall appoint guardians for the pur
poses of the action of all such minors who have no such general guard
ian, and the acts of all such guardians shall be binding upon their
wards. Every such guardian shall give bond to the state, to be filed
with the clerk of the court, in such sum and with such surety as the
court shall direct, and to be by it approved, conditioned for the faith
ful performance of his duties as guardian, and that he will render a
just and true account of his guardianship in all courts and place;
when thereunto required, and that he will observe all the orders of the
court in relation to his trust. If such general guardian, or guardian
so appointed, fail to give and file such bond, the clerk of the court
shall be appointed such guardian, in which case the court may dis
pense with his giving such bond.
Section 3105. Any defendant may deny the joint tenancy, or tenancy
in common, of any codefendant, and any issue of fact between
tne parties may be tried by a jury, as in other cases.
Section 3106. Either before or after the trial of such issue, the
court may permit the complaint and all subsequent proceedings to be
amended, so as to represent truly the rights claimed by any party, or
so as to make any person a defendant who shall have appeared in the
course of the proceedings to be interested in the premises, and who
might originally have been made a defendant if his interest had then
existed or been known; but no person shall be so made a defendant,
unless by his consent, without eight days' notice of the motion to this
effect being personally served on him, or published once in each week,
successively, for one month, in such paper as the court may direct
Section 3107. After such amendment, any party whose rights are
Qr m&^ ^e affected thereby, may serve an answer, or amended answer,
to the complaint, within such time as shall be fixed by the court, no:
less than twenty days, and may maintain his claim or defense, as the
circumstances of the case may render proper.
Section 3108. In case any or all the defendants fail to answer the
complaint, proof shall be made of the allegations thereof, and if any
issues are made, after trial thereof, the court, upon the proofs made in
either case, shall determine the rights of the parties, and by order
declare the rights, titles and interests of the several parties to the
premises, and direct that partition be made between such of them as
shall be proved to have any right, title or interest therein, according
to such rights, titles and interests,
Section 3109. If the right or interest in such premises of any
Party, who has not appeared or answered, whether known or unknown,
shall not be made to appear by the proofs so taken, the court shall
order that partition be made, so far as the rights and interests of the
parties who are known, and who have appeared or answered, have been
ascertained, and the residue of the premises shall remain for the par
ties whose interests have not been ascertained, subject to partition
among them at any future time,
Section 3110. Such order for partition shall contain a clause
referring it to a proper person to inquire into the situation of the prem
ises, and to report whether the premises, or any part of them, are so cir
cumstanced that a partition thereof among the parties interested can-
not be made without great prejudice to the owners, and also to inquire
and report whether the interest of the parties will be promoted by
platting the property sought to be partitioned, or any part thereof.
Section 3111. If, upon the coming in of such report, the court
shall be satisfied that the partition of the premises can be made with-
out great prejudice to the owners, it shall, by order, appoint three dis
interested freeholders, commissioners to make the partition so ad
judged, and according to the rights and interests of the parties as 60
ascertained; and in such order, the part or shares, if any, which shall
remain undivided for the owners whose interests have not been ascer
tained, shall be designated; and if, also, upon the coming in of said
report, the court shall be satisfied that the interests of the parties will
be promoted by platting the premises, or any parti thereof, it shall, by
the same order, direct such commissioners to make and acknowledge
a plat of such premises, or a part thereof to be designated, laying out
streets, roads and alleys therein as they may deem most beneficial to
the owners; which plat, when made, approved by the court and
recorded as other plats are required to be recorded by law, shall have
the same effect and validity, as if duly made by the parties to the
action pursuant to chapter one hundred and one. "When such plat is
so made, approved and recorded, partition or sale if ordered may be
made in accordance therewith.
Section 3112. If either of the persons so appointed commissioners
shall die, resign, or neglect or refuse to serve, the court may, from
time to time, appoint others in their places. Before proceeding to
the execution of their duties, they shall be severally sworn honestly
and impartially to make partition as directed by the court, which oath
shall be filed with the clerk of the court on or before the coming in
of their report.
Section 3113. In making partition, they shall divide the said real
estate, and allot the several portions or shares thereof to the respect
ive parties, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to
the respective rights and interests of the parties as so declared in said
order of the court, designating the several shares and portions by
posts, stones or other permanent monuments; and, if necessary, they
may employ a surveyor, with necessary assistants to aid them in the
discharge of their duties.
Section 3114. All the commissioners must meet together in the
performance of any of their duties, but the acts of a majority so metr
shall be valid. They shall report in writing, under the hand of any
two of them, specifying the manner of executing their trust, and
describing the land divided, and the shares allotted to each party, with
convenient certainty, and the items of their charges. Their expenses,
including those of a surveyor and assistants, shall be subject to the
approval of the court, and, with the compensation allowed by the
court for their services, shall be paid by the plaintiff, and allowed as
part of the costs to be taxed.
Section 3115. On good cause shown, the court may set aside theK
, • ,, ° . , . . . • . .
report and refer the case to the same, or appoint uew commissioners,
as often as may be necessary, who shall proceed in like manner as
hereinbefore directed.
Section 3116. Notice of the application to confirm said report
shall be given to all the parties that have appeared, and upon confir-
mation thereof, judgment shall be entered that the partition so
ordered and made, be firm and effectual forever, and such judgment
shall be final and conclusive:
t
1. On all the parties to such action and their legal representative!
except as hereinbefore provided and as provided in the next section
2. On all persons interested in the premises who may be unknown,
who shall be served in such action as provided by law.
3. On all persons claiming, or to claim from such parties or persons,
or c't'ier °f them, subsequent to the filing of the notice of the peudency
of the action.
A copy of such report and judgment, certified to be such in the
manner required by law to make them evidence, shall be recorded in
each county in which any part of the premises are situated, and the
expense of such copy and record shall be taxed in the costs,
Section 3117. buch judgment shall not affect any tenants, or per
sons having claims as tenants, in dower, by the curtesy, for life, or for
years, in the whole of the premises; nor shall it preclude any person,
except those mentioned in the preceding and not excepted in this sec
tion, from claiming any title to such premises, or from controverting
the title or interest of the parties between whom partition is made,
Section 3118. Such judgment must direct that eachof thepa^
ties, who is entitled to the immediate possession of a distinct parte!
allotted to him, be let into the possession thereof immediately, or
after the determination of a particular estate, as the case may require.
If any party, or his legal representatives, withhold possession thereof
from the party adjudged to be entitled thereto, or his legal represent
atives, he may be punished for his disobedience as for a contempt, and
the court may make an order, or issue a writ of assistance, directing
the sheriff to put such party or his legal representatives in possession
thereof, which order shall be executed as if it were an execution.
Section 3119. If the person to whom the reference is made, as
provided iu section three thousand and ten, shall report that the
premises, or any distinct portion thereof, are so situated that parti
tion thereof cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners,
the court, if satisfied that such is the fact, may make an order direct
ing the sheriff or a referee to sell the premises so situated, at public
auction, to the highest bidder. Such order shall direct the terms of
credit which may be allowed for any portion of the purchase money,
of which the court shall think proper to direct the investment, or as
is required by the provisions hereinafter contained to be invested for
the benefit of any unknown owners, infants, nonresidents or tenants
for life, years, dower or by the curtesy.
Section 3120. Before making such order of sale, if any creditor
having lien, by judgment, mortgage or otherwise, upon the undivided
interest or estate of any of the parties, has not been made a party, the
court shall direct the complaint to be amended so as to make him a party
and in such order of sale shall direct the sheriff to pay to the clerk of the
court the portion of the moneys arising from the sale of the interest
or estate to which such lien attaches, after deducting its proportion of
the costs of such sale, which proportion shall be fixed by the
court.
Section 3121. Whenever the estate of any tenant in dower, by the
curtesy, for life or for years, in the whole, or any part or share, of the
premises, has been ascertained by the court, and is existing at the
time of the order for suvh sale, and the person entitled to such estate
is a party to the action, the court shall determine whether, under all
the circumstances of the case, such estate ought to be excepted from
such sale, and may so provide in such order. If a sale of the prem
ises, including such estate, is ordered, such estate shall pass thereby,
and the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shall have the same discharged
from all claim hy virtue of such estate.
Section 3122. The sheriff or referee shall give notice of such sale
for the same time, and in the same manner, as is required hy law for
sales of real estate on execution. The terms of sale shall be made
known at the time thereof, and if the premises consist of distinct
lots, tracts or parcels, they shall be sold separately. Neither the
sheriff or referee, nor any person for his benefit, shall purchase at
such sale, or be interested directly or indirectly in any purchase of the
premises 6old; nor shall any guardian of a ward purchase or be
interested in any way in the purchase of any of the premises except
for the benefit or on behalf of such ward; and all 6ales to the con
trary hereof shall be void.
Section 3123. The portions of the purchase money for which credit
shall be allowed, shall always be secured, at interest, by a mortgage
of the premises sold, by the bond of the purchaser, and by such other
security as the court shall prescribe; and the sheriff or referee may
take separate mortgages and other securities, for such convenient
shares or portions of the purchase money as are directed by the court
to be invested, in the name of the clerk of the court where the action
is pending, and his successors in office, and for such shares as any
known owner of full age shall desire to have so invested, in the name
:>f such owner. Upon such sales being confirmed, as hereinafter
mentioned, such sheriff or referee shall deliver such mortgages and
jther securities to the clerk, or to the known owners whose share was
so invested.
Section 3124. After completing such sale, the sheriff or referee
shall report the same to the court, with a description of the differ-
jut parcels of land sold to each purchaser, the name of such pur
chaser, and the price bid by him, which report shall be filed in the
court.
Section 3125. If the sale is confirmed by the court, judgment
>hall be entered directing the sheriff or referee to execute conveymces
pursuant thereto, and also directing the application of the pro
ceeds of such sale. Such judgment, and conveyances executed pur
suant thereto, are binding upon the persons named in section three
housand one hundred and sixteen, and shall effectually bar each of
:uch persons from all right, title and interest in the property sold,
lot purchased by him.
Section 3126. Unless the court otherwise direct, the costs of
ivery party to the action must be deducted from the proceeds of the
ale and paid to his attorney; but the court may, in its discretion,
lircct the costs and expenses of any trial, reference or other proceedng
in the action, to be paid out of the share of any party in such
>roceeds, or may render judgment against any party therefor.
Section 3127. The proceeds of every sale shall be paid into court
)y the sheriff or referee with his report, and after deducting costs,
shall be divided among the parties whose rights or interests have been
sold, in proportion to their respective rights in the premises. The
nun chargeable upon any share to satisfy the lien of any creditor shall
» paid to him as hereinafter provided, and, except as thus provided,
:he share of such of the parties as shall be of full age shall be paid
x> them when not hereinafter otherwise provided.
Section 312S. Anv creditor, beinjy a party to the action, bavins:
... -,. ., , , ° . *■ J. . ., .' . P
inch hen upon any undivided snare or interest in the premises sold,
w aDy party owning such share, may apply to the court to order the
amount due such creditor to be paid, which application shall be accompanied
with:
1. An affidavit stating the amount actually due upon such incum
brance or lien, and the name and residence of the owner thereof, to be
made by the party applying, his agent or attorney.
2. An affidavit showing service of a notice of such application by
the party applying, upon the other party, either personally or by leav
ing a copy of it at his residence, if absent therefrom, with some per
son of his household of proper age at least fourteen days previously.
If the party to be served with such notice reside out of the state, the
notice may be served personally, or published in such newspaper as
the court may direct, three weeks successively, once in each week, im
mediately previous to such application, of which publication proof
must be filed.
Section 3129. Upon such application and proof of notice, the conn
6nan proceed to hear the proofs and allegations of the parties; and if
any question of fact shall arise, which, in the opinion of the court,
cannot be satisfactorily determined without a trial by jury, the conn
shall direct an issue to be made, which shall be tried as in other cases,
and the costs of such trial shall be paid by the party failing, which
payment shall be enforced as in other cases.
Section 3130. "When the amount of the existing unsatisfied incum-
brances or liens upon any undivided shares shall have been ascer
tained, the court must order a distribution of the money pertaining
to such shares to be made among the creditors having such incum
brances or liens, according to the priority thereof, respectively; ani
the clerk of the court shall procure satisfaction thereof to be acknow.edged,
as required by law, and cause such incumbrance or lien to le
duly satisfied and canceled of record, and the expenses thereof shall
be paid by or out of the money belonging to the party by whom such
incumbrance was payable.
Section 3131. The proceedings to ascertain and settle the amount
0j incumbrances, as herein provided, shall not affect any other party
in such action, nor delay the paying over or investing the moneys to
or for the benefit of any party upon whose estate in the premises
there shall not appear to be any existing incumbrance.
Section 3132. Where any known party is an infant, the court may,
in its discretion, direct his share to be paid to his general guardian, or

(his benefit.
Section 3133. When a party, whose interest has been sold, is ab-
sent from the state, without legal representatives in this state, and has
not appeared in the action, or is unknown, or not named in the pro
ceedings, the court shall direct his share to be invested in permanent
securities, at interest, for his benefit, until claimed by him or his legal
representatives,
Section 3134. When the proceeds of a sale belonging to any ten-
ant jQ dower, or by the curtesy, for life or for years, shall be brought
into court as hereinbefore provided, the court shall direct the same to
be invested in permanent securities, at interest, so that such interest
shall annually be paid to the parties entitled to such estate during
their lives, respectively, except as otherwise provided in the next sec
tion.
Section 3135. Any party to the action who has a right of dower,
vested or inchoate, or is a tenant in dower, by the curtesy, for life or
for years, shall be entitled to receive from the proceeds of the sale »

mknown, the court shall provide for the protection of his rights, in
he same manner as if he was known and had appeared. In all cases,
;he proper proportion of expenses shall be deducted from the proceeds
>f sale.
Section 313G. The court may, in its discretion, require all or any
)f the parties, before they shall receive any share of the moneys arisng
from such sales, to give security to the satisfaction of such court,
;o refund the said share, with interest thereon, in case it shall there
after appear that such party was not entitled thereto.

infant married woman will be promoted thereby, confirm such reporl
and authorize such guardian or husband to execute conveyances i
such parts of such lands as have been agreed to be sold, and to exi
cute all conveyances of the right and interest of such ward or infa

and as shall fall to the share of the other persons having rights and
interests in such lauds, and to receive from such persons conveyances
agreed to he made by them.

son mentally incapable of managing his own affairs, as if the samenad

the respective owners.
Section 3150. Such action shall be brought, and the persons par-
,. , i ii i i .ti ** . • r i.
ties thereto, shall be served with process therein, as in proceedings
under this chapter for the partition of lands, and when so served, or

determine the rights of the parties, the court may, by order, appoint
not less than three commissioners, and empower and direct them to
examine into any matters complained of, and upon reasonable notice
to the owners or occupants of the water powers, to enter upon and take
eoutrol of the mills, machinery, flumes, gates, wheels and other appur

of the same as will enable them to ascertain the respective rights of
the parties, and to determine the manner of using, applying and pre

Section 3151. Said commissioners shall, before entering upon their
duties, take and file in said court an oath, faithfully to perform their
duties as such; shall proceed with reasonable dispatch to investigate
the matters complained of; shall examine witnesses touching such

CHAPTER CXXXV.
OF ACTIONS FOR THE FORECLOSURE OF MORTGAGES.
Section 3154. In actions for the foreclosure of mortgages upot
reaj ggtate, if the plaintiff recover, the court shall render judgment of
foreclosure and sale as hereinafter provided, of the mortgaged premises,
or gucjJ part thcreof as may be sufficient to pay the amount adjudged
to be due upon the mortgage and obligation secured thereby, with costs.
Section 3155. The proceeds of every sale made under such judg
ment shall be applied to the discharge of the debt adjudged by such
court to be due, and the costs awarded ; and if there shall be any sur
plus, it shall be brought into court for the use of the defendant, or of
the person who may be entitled thereto, subject to the order of the
court. If such surplus, or any part thereof, shall remain in the said
court for the term of three months, without being applied for, the court
shall direct the same to be put out at interest for the benefit of the de
fendant, his representatives or assigns, to be paid to them by the order
of such court.
Section 3156. In all such actions, the plaintiff may in his complaint,
unite with his claim for a foreclosure and sale a demand for judgment
for any deficiency which may remain due to the plaintiff, after sale of
the mortgaged premises, against every party who may be personally
iable for the debt secured by the mortgage, whether the mortgagor or
other persons, if upon the same contract which the mortgage is given
to secure; and judgment of foreclosure and sale, and also for any such
leticiency remaining after applying the proceeds of sale to the amount
. . - f ii~p . r *. •* , " r , . ,
adjudged to be due for principal, interest and costs, may in such case
be rendered. Such judgment for deficiency shall be ordered in the
original judgment, and separately rendered against the party liable, on
or after the coming in and confirmation of the report of sale, and be
docketed and enforced as in other cases.
Section 3157. Whenever an action shall be commenced for the
foreclosure of any mortgage, upon which there shall be due any interest,
or any portion or installment of the principal, and there shall be other
portions or installments to become due subsequently, the action shall be
dismissed upon the defendant's bringing into court, at any time before
judgment, the principal and interest due, with the costs. If after judg
ment is entered in such case, the defendant shall bring into court the
principal and interest due, with the costs, proceedings on the judgment
shall be stayed; but the court may enforce the judgment by a further
order, upon a subsequent default in the payment of any portion or in
stallment of the principal, or of any interest thereafter to grow due
Section 3158. If, in the cases mentioned in the last preceding section,
the defendant shall not, before judgment, bring into court the
amonnt so due, with costs, the court, before rendering judgment, shall
direct a reference to some proper person, to ascertain and report the sit-
uation of the mortgaged premises, and whether they can be sold in
parcels without injury to the interests of the parties; and if it shall
appear that they can be so sold, the judgment shall direct a sale in pareels,
specifying them, or of so much thereof as will be sufficient to pay
the amount then due for principal, interest and costs; and such judg
ment shall remain as security for any subsequent default.
Section 3159. If, in the case mentioned in the preceding section,
there shall be any default subsequent to such judgment, in the pay-
ment of any portion or installment of the principal, or of any interest
due upon such mortgage, the court may, upon petition of the complain
ant, by a further order, founded upon such first judgment, direct a sale
of so much of the mortgaged premises, to be made under the said judg
ment, as will be sufficient to satisfy the amount so due, with the costs
of such petition and the subsequent proceedings thereon; and the same
proceedings shall be had as often as a default shall happen.
Section 3160. If, in any of the foregoing cases, it shall appear tow
the court, that the mortgaged premises are so situated that they cannot
be sold in parcels without injury to the interests of the parties, or that
the sale of the whole will be most beneficial to them, the court may
adjudge the sale of the whole accordingly, in which case the proceeds
of sale, after deducting the costs of the action and of sale, shall be ap
plied to the payment of the sums then due and also to become due
thereafter; deducting from all sums not due, which do not bear interest,
interest from the time of payment to the time when the same are pay
able; or the court may direct the balance of the proceeds of sale, after
paying the sum then due, with such costs, to be placed at interest for
the benefit of the plaintiff, to be paid to him as such subsequent pay
ments or installments shall become due, with the interest thereon. The
surplus, after paying the amount due the plaintiff, and such costs, shall
in all cases, be paid to the defendant, his representatives or assigns, or
to the party equitably entitled thereto, on the order o-f the court
Section 3101. In any action for the foreclosure of a mortgage,at
any time after judgment, and before a sale pursuant thereto, the plain
tiff may be granted leave to amend the summons, complaint and all
the proceedings in the action, by making as defendant any person who
is a proper or necessary party thereto. Such person so made a party
shall be served with the summons in like manner as if originally a
party, and may answer and defend, and all matters and proceedings as
to him shall be had and taken, in like manner as if he had been origin
ally made a party thereto. After such person has been thus made a
party and served, and his rights adjudicated upon, the original judgment
may be so amended as to bar and foreclose him thereby, or to make any
provisions in regard to his rights and interests, in like manner as it could
have done had he been made originally a party.
Section 3162. In all such actions, if tiie plaintiff shall recover, the
judgment shall fix the amount of the mortgage debt then due, and also
•the amount of each installment thereafter to grow due, and the sever.,
tiines when they will become so due, and shall adjudge that the mortgage(l
premises be sold for the payment of the amount adjudged to be
twen ^ue> anc^ °^ *^ installments which shall thereafter grow due
before the sale, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to pay such
amount for principal, interest and costs, including costs of sale, and
when demanded in the complaint, an order directing that judgment he
rendered for any deficiency against the parties personally liable there
for; but no such sale shall be made until the expiration of one year
from the date of such judgment or order of sale; and when judgment
is for installments due and to grow due, and payment shall be made
within the year of the installments found due at the date of the judg
ment, with interest and costs, no sales shall be made upon any install
ment growing due after the date of the judgment, until the expiration
of one year after the same shall become due; but in all cases the par
ties may, by stipulation in writing, to be filed with the clerk, consent
to an earlier sale. The provisions of this section shall not apply to
judgments of foreclosure and sale of mortgages given by any railroad
corporation, but such sales may be made immediately after the rendi
tion of the judgment.
Section 3163. If any defendant appear and answer that any portion
of the mortgaged premises is a homestead, the court shall ascertain
whether such be the fact, and if so, whether the part of the mortgaged
premises, not included in the homestead, can be sold separately therefrom
without injury to the interests of the parties, and in that case shall
direct in the judgment that the homestead shall not be sold until all the
other mortgaged lands have been sold,
Section 3164. The amount adjudged to be due in the judgment
^^ <jraw interest, at the rate of ten per centum per annum, from itt
date until the date of sale or payment, and all installments which shall
become due after the date of such judgment, shall draw interest at
the same rate from the time the same shall become due. The court
may also, in the judgment, enjoin the defendants, and all persons claim
ing under them, from committing any waste, or doing any act that
may impair the value of such premises at any time after the date of
the judgment.
Section 3165. The mortgagor, his heirs, personal representatives,
assignSj may redeem the mortgaged premises from the effect of said
judgment, and the lien of the mortgage thereon, at any time before the
sale of such premises, by paying to the clerk of the court in which the
judgment was rendered, or to the plaintiff therein, or any assignee
thereof, or to his attorney, the amount of such judgment, interest
thereon as aforesaid, and costs, and any costs subsequent to euch judg
ment, and any sums paid by the plaintiff subsequent to the judgment,
for, or in redemption of, taxes, assessed upon the mortgaged premises,
with interest thereon from the date of payment, at the same rate. On
payment to such clerk as aforesaid, or on filing the receipt of the
plaintiff, or his assigns or attorney, for such payment, in the office of
said clerk, he shall thereupon discharge such judgment, and a certifi
cate of such discharge, duly recorded in the office of the register of
deeds, shall discharge such mortgage of record, to the extent of the sum
so paid.
Section 3166. Incase the mortgagor, his heirs, representatives or
assigns shall desire to pay a portion 01 such judgment, taxes, interest
and costs, so as to relieve any distinct lot or parcel of the premises
which can be sold separately under such judgment from the lien
thereof, and of such mortgage thereon, the court, on application of
such person, and on notice to the parties to the action may, if the
amount to be paid therefor is not agreed upon, ascertain and adjudge
the proportion of such judgment, taxes, interest and costs to be paid
for the purpose aforesaid; and when the amount so adjudged shall be
paid as aforesaid, it shall relieve such distinct lot or parcel from such
judgment and the lien of such mortgage thereon, and shall satisfy
such judgment to the amount so paid. Any heir, devisee, grantee or
assignee of the mortgagor, owning an undivided interest in the mort
gaged premises, subject to the lien of the mortgage, may redeem such
undivided interest from such judgment and the lien of the mortgage
thereon, by paying as aforesaid a sum that will bear the same projxjrtion
to the whole of such judgment, taxes, costs and interest as
the interest proposed to be redeemed bears to the whole of the mort
gaged premises.
Section 3167. Any person having a lien, acquired at any time before
the sale, upon the mortgaged premises, or any part thereof, or interest
therein, subsequent to the lien of any such mortgage, may also, at any
time before such sale, pay to the clerk of said court, or the plaintiff in
such judgineut, or any assignee thereof, or to his attorney, the amount
of such judgment, taxes, interest thereon as aforesaid, .and costs, and
any costs subsequent to such judgment, and shall thereupon be subro
gated to all the rights of the plaintiff as to such judgment, with full
power to enforce the same, unless the same shall have been paid by the
mortgagor, or person personally liable for the mortgage debt, as provided
in the preceding section.
Section 3168. The sheriff or referee who makes sale of mortgaged
premises, under a judgment therefor, shall give notice of the time and
place of sale, in the manner provided by law for the sale of real estate
upon execution, or in such other manner as the court shall in the judg
ment direct. He shall, within ten days thereafter, file with the clerk
of the court, a report of the sale, and immediately after the sale, shall
pay to the parties entitled thereto, or their attorneys, the proceeds of
the sale, after deducting the cost thereof, unless otherwise ordered by
the court.
Section 3169. Upon any such sale being made, the sheriff, or referee
making the same, on compliance with its terms, shall make, execute and
deliver to the purchaser a deed of the premises sold, setting forth each
parcel of land sold to him, and the sum paid therefor, which deed.npon
the confirmation of such sale, shall vest in the purchaser all the right,
title and interest of the mortgagor, his heirs, personal representatives,
and assigns, in and to the premises sold, and shall be a bar to all claim,
right, or equity of redemption therein, of and against the parties to
such action, their heirs, and personal representatives, and also against
all persons claiming under them subsequent to the filing of the notice
of the pendency of the action in which such judgment was rendered;
and the purchaser, his heirs and assigns shall be let into the possession
of the premises so sold, on production of such deed, or a duly certified
copy thereof, and the court may, if necessary, issue a writ of assistance
to deliver such possession.

otherwise order. It shall be sufficient to aver in the complaint in such
action the nature and extent of the plaintiff's estate in such land, describmS
'* as accurately as may be, and that he is in possession thereof, and
that the defendant makes some claim thereto, and to demand judgment
that the plaintiff's claim be established against any claim of the defendai,t>
and that he be forever barred against having or claiming any right
or title to the land, adverse to the plaintiff; and the defendant, if he do
not so disclaim and release, may answer any matter in denial of the

ative judgment affecting the title to real property, file in such register's
office a like notice. From the time of such filing, in either case, the
pendency of such action shall be constructive notice thereof to a pur
chaser or incumbrancer of the property affected thereby; and every pur
chaser or incumbrancer whose conveyance or incumbrance is not re

f.uch sheriff, or by the plaintiff, or any party to the action, interested in
having such report made, his agent or attorney, upon oath; and such
deed may be made by a referee appointed by the court for that purpose.
Such reports may be confirmed by the court, as in other cases, and such
reports and deeds shall have the same effect as if made by such sheriff,
or original referee.
Section 3190. If any tenant for life, or years, in dower, or by the
curtesy, be impleaded in respect to any lands, the person, to whom the^
remainder or reversion thereof appertains, may, upon his own applica

leave to defend the same; and he shall not be barred of his action to
recover such lands by the surrender, neglect, default, or other act of such
tenant.

fraud, against any tenant for life, in dower, or by the curtesy, of any

premises affected by such action, or of any boundary line of such prem
ises, or between the lands of any of the parties and the lands of other
persons, when satisfied that such survey is necessary or expedient to

suspended by reason of the infancy of any such heir or devisee.
Section 3275. An action against heirs or devisees to charge them
under the provisions of this chapter, must be brought jointly against
all the heirs to whom any real estate descended, or jointly against all
the devisees, as the case may be; but if all the persons so jointly liable

sary to make them defendants, on such terms as shall be just.
Section 3276. The complaint in such action must describe with
reasonable certainty the real estate which shall have so descended, or

Section 32S1. In such action any heir may show that at the time
^ ^e commencement thereof he had nothing by descent or devise, or
that he had not sufficient to satisfy the plaintiffs demand,

defendant, shall not be aliened by him before the filing of a notice

against such defendant, shall be levied out of such real estate so de
scended or devised, and not otherwise,
Seotion 3284. In such action, the sum which the plaintiff is entitled
to recover for damages and costs, must be apportioned among all the
defendants, in proportion to the value of the real property descended
or devised to such defendants, and such proportion only shall be recov
ered of each heir or devisee. The judgment shall express the amount
recovered against each defendant for damages and costs, and it may be
docketed and enforced against each defendant separately, in like man
ner and with like effect as if they were separate judgments. Each
such judgment shall have preference as a lien on the real estate de
scended or devised to any defendant, to any other judgment rendered
and docketed against such heir or devisee, for any deb£ or demand uf
his own.
Seotion 3285. No real estate descended to any heir, or devised to
any devigee, which shall have been aliened in good faith and for value

county, shall be liable to execution on any such judgment or any wav
affected thereby.
Section 328G. When it appears that, before the filing of a notice ^
tue pendency of such action, the defendant has aliened the real estate
descended or devised to him, or any part thereof, he shall be personam
liable for the value of the estate so aliened, and the plaintiff may talce
i'udgment against him for not exceeding such value, as in an action for
lis own debt.
Section 32S7. When the next of kin, legatees, heirs or devisees, are
liable for demands against the decedent as prescribed in this chapter,
they shall be given preference in the payment of the same, and shall
be liable therefor in the following order:
1. Debts entitled to preference under the laws of the United States.
2. Judgments docketed against the decedent, according to the priority
thereof, respectively.
3. All other debts arising or growing out of any contract.
Section 3288. No preference shall be given by any next of kin,
legatee, heir or devisee, to any debt, over other debts of the same class,
except those specified in the second class of the preceding section; nor
shall a debt, due and payable, be entitled to a preference over debts not
due; nor shall the commencement of an action against any next of kin,
legatee, heir or devisee, for the recovery of any debt, entitle such debt
to any preference over others of the same class.
Section 3289. The next of kin, legatee, heirs and devisees, may
show that there are debts of a prior class unsatisfied, or thai there
are unpaid debts of the same class with that on which the action is
brought ; and if it appear that the value of the personal property deliv
ered to them, or of the real estate descended or devised to them, does
not exceed the debts of a prior class, judgment shall be rendered in
their favor.
Section 3290. If the personal property delivered to such next of
kin or legatee, or if the real estate descended or devised to such heirs
or devisees, exceed the amount of debts which are entitled to a prefer
ence over the debt for which the action is brought, judgment shall be
rendered against them only for such a sum as shall be a just proportion
to the other debts of the same class, with that on which the action is
brought.
Section 3291. If any debt of a prior class to that on which the
action is brought, or of the same class, shall have been paid by any
next of tin, legatees, heirs or devisees, they may give evidence of such
payment, and the amount of debts so paid shall be estimated in ascer
taining the amount to be recovered, in the same manner as if such
debts were outstanding and unpaid, as prescribed in the two last sec
tions.
Section 3292. A child born after the making of a will, who is
entitled to succeed to a portion of the real or personal property or
both of the testator, or a witness to a will, who is entitled to recover
any portion of such property from the legatees or devisees, shall have
the same rights and remedies to compel a distribution of the personal
property and partition of the real estate, or to recover of the legatees
or devisees such portion of the property as belongs to him, or to com
pel a contribution from other persons interested in the estate, or to gain
possession of the property, as any other persons who are entitled to any
part of such estate, and shall be equally liable to the creditors of the
decedent, under the provisions of this chapter.
Section 3293. It any of the heirs, devisees, legatees or next of kin
shall die without having paid his just share of the debts of his decedent,

grovided, if it shall appear to the court that the owner and contractor
■audulently, and for the purpose of defrauding subcontractors, fixed
an unreasonably low price in their original contract for the erection,
or repairing of such building, then the court shall ascertain how much
of a difference exists between a fair price for labor or material used
in said building or other improvement and the sum named in said
original contract. Said difference shall be considered a part of the

contractor's time or profits be secured by this lien, only so far a* the
sum named in the original contract or agreement.
Section 3316. All claims for liens and rights of action to recover
therefor under this chapter, shall be assignable so as to vest in the

or other building, or the same machinery, bridge, wharf, well, foun
tain, fence or water lot, may join as plaintiffs; and if any do not so

persons having liens upon the premises by mortgage, judgment or
otherwise, subsequent to the lien sought to be foreclosed, and all pur
chasers of the premises subsequent to such lien, may be joined a
parties defendant. In case any person who has filed such claim for
lien, prior to the commencement of such action, or who has such
subsequent lien, or who is snch subsequent purchaser, is not made >
party to such action, he may, upon application, at any time before
judgment, be made a party defendant thereto; and any person, who shall
tile such claim for lien after the commencement of such action, or who
uhall obtain such subsequent lien, by mortgage, judgment or other
wise, or become such subsequent purchaser, after the filing of the
notice of the pendency of such action, may, at any time before judg
ment, upon application, be made a party defendant thereto. If such
action be brought by a subcontractor, the principal contractor may
also be made a party defendant thereto,
Section 3322. The complaint in such action shall be sufficient, ii
it set forth the contract in substance, under which such work was done
or materials furnished, with the last date of doing or furnishing tie
same, and the assignment of the claim, if any; and allege that the
plaintiff or his assignee has filed a claim for a lieu therefor as required
C
by law, giving the date of such filing, that such work was done or
materials furnished for some of the purposes mentioned in section
three thousand three hundred and fourteen, stating for what particular
purpose, the amount claimed to be due to the plaintiff or plaintiffs,
respectively; and give a description of the premises claimed to '^
affected by such lien; as to defendants who have filed claims for liens
on said premises under the provisions of this cha- ter, that tber hare
filed such claims, giving the date of filing and the amount claimed by
each; as to defendants having subsequent liens, or being subsequent

liens upon snch premises, whether plaintiffs or defendants, be ascer
tained and adjudged; and that the interest of the person owning such
premises at the time of the commencement of the construction, repairs,
removal or work of or upon the dwelling house, building, machinery,
bridge, wharf, or erection thereon, well, fountain, fence, water lot or
land, on account of which such liens are claimed, or which he oran|
other person claiming under him has since acquired, be sold to satisfr
the amount of the liens so ascertained and adjudged, with the costs of
the action. If the action be brought by a subcontractor, the complaint
shall also set forth in substance the contract between him and tbe con
tractor, and allege that he gave the notice required by section three
thousand three hundred and fifteen, and the date of the service
thereof.
Section 3323. Any issue of fact in such action shall on demand
of either party be tried by a jury, whose verdict thereon shall be conelusive
as in other cases.
Section 332+. The judgment in such action shall adjudge the
amount due to the plaintiff, or in case several claims for liens are em
braced in the action, the amount due to each claimant who is a party
to the action. It shall direct that the interest of the owner in thei
premises at the time of the commencement of the construction, repairs,
removal, or work of or upon the dwelling house, building, machinery,
bridge, wharf, or erection thereon, well, fountain, fence, water lot or
land, on account of which such liens are claimed, or which he, or any
person claiming under him, has 6ince acquired, or so much thereof as
may be necessary, be sold to satisfy the amount of the lien of the
plaintiff, or of the several liens embraced in the action, with the costs
of such action, including the costs of filing the claims for lien; and
that after satisfying the same, together with such costs, that the resi
due of the proceeds be brought into court, with the report of sale, to
abide the order of the court. If the premises can be sold in parcels
without injury to, or to the advantage of, the parties, the court may
idjudge that the sale be so made. If the plaintiff in any such action
fail to establish his lien upon the premises described in his complaint
and claim for lien, but establish a right to recover upon contract for
his alleged work and labor done, or materials furnished, he may have
a personal judgment in the action against the party liable for the
amount due him, with or without costs, to be taxed in his favor or in
favor of the defendant, in like manner as if the action wore for the
rsooverv of money only.
Section 3325. From the proceeds of such sale, the several claimants,
whose liens were established and adjudged in the action, shall bec
paid equally and alike, without priority among themselves; and if the
sum realized at such sale shall be insufficient, after paying the costs
of the action and the costs of making the sale, to pay the full amount
adjudged to be due all such claimants, then the same shall be distrib
uted and paid to each of them in the proportion which the sum ad
judged to each bears to the whole amount adjudged to all, and the
judgment shall so direct.

shall give notice thereof in the manner provided by law tor the sale of
real estate upon execution, unless the court shall order other or differ
ent notice to be given, and shall be absolute and without redemption;
and the deed given thereon, in case such sale is confirmed, shall be
effectual to pass to the purchaser all the interest in the premises di
rected to be sold. Such sheriff or referee shall, within ten days after
making such sale, file with the clerk of the court in which the judg
ment is rendered, a report of the sale for confirmation thereof, and
shall, immediately after the sale, pay to the parties entitled thereto
the amounts adjudged to them respectively, after deducting the costs
thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the court. If any deficiency
arise upon such sale in the payment of the sums adjudged to be due
to any such claimant of a lien given by this chapter, the sheriff or
referee shall specify the amount of such deficiency in his report, and
if demanded in the complaint, or in the answer of any such lien
claimant, the court, upon confirming such sale, may render judgment
therefor against the defendant legally liable to pay the same, which
judgment may be docketed and enforced in the same manner that
ordinary judgments are.
Section 3327. Every person who has received satisfaction or tenof
his debt, with the costs of any action brought thereon, ot
, » . . j* , . - _ _ jst j ,
of any judgment recovered thereior, for which he has nledanvsnci

premises affected thereby, or in having such lien removed, on par
ment of the costs of satisfying the 6ame, execute and deliver by him
self or his attorney the necessary acknowledgment of satisfaction
thereof; on filing which with the clerk of the court with whom suci
lien is docketed, such clerk shall enter satisfaction of such claim; or
the lien claimant may enter the same satisfied on the docket of such
lien. On failure to so execute and deliver such acknowledgment of
satisfaction, or to so satisfy 6uch lien on the docket, the person refus
ing shall be liable to pay to the person requiring such acknowledg
ment, a sum equal to one-half of the sum claimed in his claim for
lien, to be recovered by action.

against such principal contractor, and such county, town, city, village,
or school district, jointly, for the recovery thereof; but no judgment
shall be rendered against any defendant therein, other than such prin
cipal contractor, for any amount greater than the amount due from

such action. Such county, town, city, village, or school district,
ivhen served with the summons in any such action, may give notice

amount due from it to such principal contractor, at the time of the
commencement of such action, or to a sufficient amount to pay the
judgment recovered against the principal contractor, and payment
thereof shall discharge its indebtedness to such principal contractor
to the amount so paid. Such principal contractor may, in suck ac
tion, file in the court in which it is commenced, a bond, in such sun

of the mill or dam does not agree to pay such reduced compensation,
but brings a new action to obtain a diminution thereof, he shall not be
entitled to costs, but shall pay costs to the adverse party, unless the
annual compensation shall be reduced by the verdict to a sum less than

tempts have been usually adopted and practiced in courts of record, to
enforce the civil remedies of any party or to protect the rights of any
such party.
Section 3478. "When any such misconduct shall be committed in
the immediate view and presence of the court, it may be punished summarily
by fine or imprisonment or both, as hereinafter provided. For
that purpose an order must be made by the court stating the facts which
constituted the offense and bring the case within the provisions of this section, and particularly and specifically prescribe the punishment to be
inflicted therefor.
Section 3479. When any order of the court or a judge shall have
been made requiring the payment of costs, or any other sum of money,
and proof by affidavit shall be made of the personal demand of such

party and to bring him before such court to answer for such miscon
duct. Such order to show cause may be made, or attachment may be
issued by any judge in vacation, but must be made returnable to the

court shall have made some order in the premises, unless such defend
ant entitles himself to be discharged as prescribed in the nest sec
tion. But when, from sickness or any other cause, the defendant is
unable to attend court, that fact shall be a sufficient excuse for not bring
ing him before the court. The officer need not in any case confine
any person so arrested in any prison, or otherwise restrain him of his
liberty, except so far as shall be necessary to secure his personal at
tendance.
Section 3484. Such defendant shall be discharged from arrest upon
such attachment, when there is an indorsement thereon as presented

upon such attachment, to the effect that the defendant will appear on
the return of such attachment and abide the order and judgment of
the court thereupon,
Section 34S5. If the party charged with misconduct be in the cos-
tody of any officer by virtue of an execution against his body, or by
virtue of any process for any other contempt or misconduct, instead of
issuing an attachment, the court or judge may award a writ of habeas
corpus to bring the defendant before the court to answer for such mis
conduct; and upon the delivery of such writ to the officer having the
custody of the defendant, he shall bring him on the return day of
such writ before the court to which the 6ame is returnable, and detain
him at the place where the court is sitting until the further order of
the court.
Section 3486. Upon the return day of an attachment, or of such
writ of habeas corpus, the officer executing the same shall file the same
and the undertaking, if any, taken by him of the defendant, together
with a written return stating the manner in which he has executed such
attachment or writ.
Section 3487. The officer to whom any such attachment shall be
delivered shall return the same by the return day specified therein ;
and in case of default, an attachment may be issued against him of
course, upon being allowed by the court or judge, upon proof of such
default. The officer to whom such last mentioned attachment shall be
delivered, shall execute the same by arresting and keeping the defend
ant in his custody, bringing him personally before the court and detain
ing him in such custody until the further order of the court without
admitting him to bail,
Section 34S8. When any defendant shall have been brought into
court by virtue of an attachment, or on such writ of habeas corpus, or
» ill!
shall have appeared upon the return of an attachment, the court suaiL
unless he admits the offense charged, cause interrogatories to be filed
specifying the facts and circumstances alleged against the defendant
and requiring his answers thereto; to which the defendant shall make
written answers on oath within such reasonable time as the court shall
allow; and the court may receive any affidavits or other proofs, con
tradictory of the answers of the defendant, or in confirmation thereof,
and upon the original affidavits, such answers and such subsequent
proof shall determine whether the defendant has been guilty of the mis
conduct alleged.
Section 3489. If, upon the hearing of an order to show cause or in
snch proceedings in case of an attachment, the court shall adjudge the
defendant to have been guilty of the miscond net alleged, and that the

in such court, it shall proceed to impose a nne or to imprison him or
both, as the nature of the case shall require. A warrant of commit-
ment must be issued accordingly.
Section 3490. If an actual loss or injury has been produced to any
party by the misconduct alleged, the court shall order a sufficient sum
to he paid by the defendant to such party to indemnify him, and to
satisfy his costs and expenses, instead of imposing a fine upon such de
fendant; and in such case the payment and acceptance of such sum
shall be an absolute bar to any action by such aggrieved party to re
cover damages for such injury or loss. Where no such actual loss or
injury has been produced, the fine shall not exceed two hundred and
fifty dollars over and above the costs and expenses of the proceedings.
Section 3491. When the misconduct proved consists of an omission
to perform some act or duty which is yet in the power of the defendant
to perform, he shall be imprisoned only until he shall have per
formed such act or duty, and paid such fine as shall be imposed and the
costs and expenses of the proceedings. In such case the order and war-
rant jf commitment shall specify the act or duty to be performed, and
the amount of the fine and expenses to be paid.
Section 3492. In every other case when no special provision is otherwise
made by law, the defendant may be imprisoned for a reasonable
time not exceeding six months, and until the fine, if any, and the ex
penses of the proceedings are paid; and the duration of such imprison
ment shall be expressed in the order and warrant of commitment.
Section 3493. Persons proceeded against under the provisions of
this chapter shall also be liable to an information or indictment for theW
same misconduct, if it be an indictable offense; but the court before
which a conviction shall be had on such information or indictment, shall
take into consideration the punishment before inflicted, in forming its
sentence.
Section 3494. If the defendant, against whom an attachment shall
have been issued and returned served, do not appear on the return day
thereof, the court may either award another attachment, or may order
the undertaking, taken on the arrest, to be prosecuted, or both.
Section 3495. The order directing the undertaking to be prose-
cuted may direct any action to be brought thereon in the name of any^,
party aggrieved; and such party may thereupon maintain an action in
his own name and recover damages to the extent of the loss or injury
sustained by him by reason of the misconduct for which the attachment
was issued, and his costs and expenses in prosecuting such attachment,
not exceeding the sum specified in such undertaking.
Section 3496. If there be no party aggrieved by the misconduct
for which the attachment was issued, the court, in case the defendant
shall fail to appear according to the conditions of the undertaking taken
on the arrest, shall order the 6ame to be prosecuted by the attorney
general, or by the district attorney for the county in which the under
taking was taken, in the name of the state, and in such action the state
shall be entitled to recover the entire sum specified in such undertak
ing. From the money collected in such action, the court shall order
such sum to be paid to the party prosecuting the attachment as it shall
think proper to satisfy'tke costs and expenses incurred by him, and to
compensate him for any injury he may have sustained by the iniscon.
duct for which such attachment was issued, and the residue shall be
paid into the state treasury to the credit of the school fund.
. Section 3497. After the return of an execution issued upon any
judgment obtained upon such undertaking unsatisfied in whole or in
part, an action to recover the amount of suchjudgment so remaining un
satisfied, may be maintained by the plaintiff who recovered such judg
ment against the officer taking such undertaking, when it appears that
at the time it was given the sureties were insufficient, and the officer
taking the same had reasonable grounds to doubt their sufficiency. If
the state was the plaintiff in the action on the undertaking, the action
against the officer must be prosecuted by the attorney general or dis
trict attorney in the name of the state, and the same disposition of the
moneys collected in such action against such officer shall be made as
directed in the preceding sections.
CHAPTER CLI.
OP PROCEEDINGS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR THE DISPOSITION OP
ESTATES OF INFANTS AND OTHER WARDS; TO ENFORCE SPECIFIC
PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS IN CERTAIN CASES; AND TO CHANGE
NAMES AND ESTABLISH HEIRSHIPS.
Section 3498. Whenever any infant or person incompetent to man
age n's affairs by reason of insanity, idiocy, unsoundness of mind or
habitual drunkenness, shall be seized or possessed of any lands, or in
terest therein, by way of mortgage, or in trust only for others, the cir
cuit court of the proper county may, upon the petition of the guardian
of such infant or incompetent person, or of any person in any way inter
ested in such real estate, make an order authorizing or compelling snch
infant or incompetent person to convey and assure such lands or interest
therein to any person entitled thereto, in such manner as the court shall
direct.
Section 3499. The circuit court shall have power to authorize or
tne specific performance of any bargain, contract or agreement,
made by any party who may die before the performance thereof, or by
any person incompetent to manage his affairs by reason of insanity,
idiocy, unsoundness of mind or habitual drunkenness, while he was
capable of conducting his affairs, by any infant heir or devisee or other
person, or by such incompetent per.-on, or his guardian, on the petition
of the executors or administrators of such deceased person, the guard
ian of such incompetent person, or of any other person interested in
such bargain, contract or agreement.
Section 3500. No order authorizing or directing any such convey
ance or assurance, or the performance of any such bargain, contract or
agreement, shall be made until after hearing the parties and beiti?; satis
fied that such conveyance or assurance ought to be made, or such bargain,
contract or agreement ought to be performed. The court may,
by such order, direct the guardian of such infant or incompetent per
son, or a special guardian appointed in such proceeding, to execute any
conveyance, or to do any other act which is necessary to carry such order
or judgment into effect. Every conveyance or assurance made, or other
act done, in pursuance of any order made under the provisions of the
preceding sections, shall be as effectual in the law, as if made by such
infant when of full age, or by such incompetent person when of sound
memory and understanding.
Section 3501. Whenever any person who is bound by a contract in
writing to convey any real estate or interest therein shall die before
making the conveyance, the person entitled thereto, or if he be dead,
then any person who would have been entitled to the estate under him,
as heir, devisee, or otherwise, in case the conveyance had been made ac
cording to the terms of the contract, or the executor or administrator
of such deceased person for the benefit of the person so entitled, may
maintain an action in the circuit court to enforce a specific performance
of the contract by the heirs, devisees, or the executor or administrator
of such deceased person who made the contract. If in such action it
shall appear that the plaintiff is entitled to have a conveyance of such
real estate, the court may require such executor or administrator to con
vey the estate in like manner as the deceased person might or ought to
have done if living; and if the heirs or devisees of such deceased per
son, or any of them, shall be within the state, and made parties to such
action, the court may require them, instead of the executor or adminis
trator, to convey the estate, or may require them to join with the ex
ecutor or administrator in such conveyance; or the court may, by its judg
ment, pass the title to such real estate to the plaintiff without any con
veyance; and every conveyance or judgment so made shall be effectual
to pass the estate contracted for as fully as if the contracting party were
still living and then executed the conveyance.
Section 3502. A copy of such judgment, directing such conveyance
or passing the title to the plaintiff, duly certified by the clerk and recorded
in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the
lands lie, shall give the person entitled to such conveyance a right to the
possession of the lands contracted for, and to hold the same according to
the terms of the intended conveyance, in like manner as if they had been
conveyed in pursuance of such judgment. The recording of such judg
ment shall not prevent the court from enforcing such judgment by any
proper proceedings therein.
Section 3503. In either of the following cases, any real estate, or
interest therein, belonging to an infant, or to a person incompetent to
manage his affairs by reason of insanity, idiocy, unsoundness of mind or
habitual drunkenness, may be sold, mortgaged or leased, as hereinafter
prescribed:
1. When the personal property and the income of the real estate of
such infant or incompetent person are together insufficient for the pay
ment of his debts, or for the maintenance and education of himself and
familv ;
2. When the interests of such infant or incompetent person require, or
will be substantially promoted by such disposition on account of such
real estate or interest therein being exposed to waste or dilapidation, or
being unproductive, or for other peculiar reasons or circumstances.
Section 3504. The application for such disposition must be made to
the circuit court of the county in which such real estate, or some part
thereof is situated, or to the circuit judge in vacation, by petition of the
general guardian of the infant or of such incompetent person, or by any
relative or other persou in behalf of either; and when the application
is on behalf of an infant over the age of fourteen years, such infant
must join in such petition. Such petition must be verified, and must
set forth the facts which would authorize the selling, mortgaging or leas
ing of such real estate or some part thereof for one or more of the rea
sons set forth in the preceding section.
Section 3505. When such application is made on behalf of an infant,
the court or circuit judge must appoint some suitable person special
guardian of such infant, in relation to the proceeding on such applica
tion, and such special guardian, and when the application is made on
behalf of an incompetent person the guardian of such incompetent
person, shall give a bond to such infant or incompetent person, by name,

direct, conditioned for the faithful performance of the trust reposed. for
Eaying over, investing or accounting for all moneys that shall be receive]
y such guardian, according to the order of any court having authority
to give directions in the premises, and for the observance of the direetions
of the court in relation to the said trust. In case of the breach f
^e con(j;t;ions 0f sucn bond, it may be prosecuted for the benefit of the
party injured, without any direction therefor.
Section 350G. Upon the presentation of such petition, and the filing
of such bond, the court or circuit judge may proceed in a snmmary
manner to inquire into the merits of such application, or may makeai:
order, referring it to some suitable person as referee, to inquire into and
report upon the matters contained in such petition, whose duty it shall
be to examine into the truth of the representations made, to hear the
parties interested in the property, or otherwise interested in the applica
tion, and report thereupon with all convenient speed.

incompetent person, or any interest therein, is necessary and proper, for
any 01 the causes mentioned in section three thousand five hundred and
three, the court or circuit judge shall make a final order, directing the
leasing, mortgaging or sale of suth real estate or interest therein, or of
such part thereof as the court shall deem proper to be made by the special

agreement by the court or judge, he must execute a lease, mortgage or
deed, as directed by the order of confirmation.
Section 3509. Whenever a final order shall have been made for
sale of any such real estate, and it shall be made to appear to the
court or judge that the interests of the infant, or incompetent person,
would be promoted by platting such real estate, the court or jud^c-
may, by order, authorize the special guardian of such infant, or the
guardian of such incompetent person, either alo"T or together with the
cotenants, if any, or other owners, to make and acknowledge a plat of
such real estate in the manner prescribed in chapter one hundred and
one a plat made pursuant to such order, certified and acknowledged
in manner and form as prescribed in said chapter, and approved by the
court, shall be as valid and effectual as if made by such infant when
of full age, or by such incompetent person when of sound memory and
understanding. After such plat shall have been duly made and
recorded, such guardians may make separate sales of any lot or lots,
according to such plat, or of such infant's or incompetent person's
interest therein, in the manner above prescribed.
Section 3510. No real estate or interest therein shall be sold, mortgaged
or leased under the provisions of this chapter, contrary to the
provisions of any will by which the same was devised, or of any con
veyance by which the same was transferred to such infant or incompe
tent person.
Section 3511. Every deed, mortgage, lease or other conveyance
made in good faith by the guardian of an infant or incompetent person,
pursuant to any order or judgment of the court, or judge thereof, made
under the provisions of this chapter, when confirmed by the court,
shall be as valid and effectual as if made by such infant when of full
age, or by such incompetent person when of sound memory and under
standing.
Section 3512. No sale made as aforesaid of the real estate of any
infant or incompetent person, shall give to such infant or incompetent

application and disposition of the proceeds of any such sale or mort
gage, and of the income derived from the investment thereof, and of
the rent accruing upon any such lease, and direct the investment of any
portion thereof belonging to such infant or incompetent person, which
is not needed for the payment of debts or the immediate support of
himself and family, so as to secure the same for the benefit of such
infant or incompetent person, and shall direct a return of such invest
ment to be made on oath as soon as may be, and shall require accounts
to be rendered periodically by any guardian or other person who may
be intrusted with the disposition of such proceeds, or the income
thereof.
Section 3514. If the real estate or interest therein of any infant
or any incompetent person directed to be sold, is subject to a right of
dower, or an estate for life or for years, in the whole or any part thereof,

sent in writing to accept a gross sum in lieu of such dower or other
estate, to be fixed according to the principles of law applicable to annui

pavment of such sum in gross, or the investment of a proportionate share
of the proceeds, and the payment of the interest thereof, to the person
having such right or estate until the expiration thereof. But no such
gross sum shall be paid, or investment made, until an effectual release
of such right or estate has been duly executed, so as to entitle the same
to be delivered to the purchaser.

in real estate consists of a right of dower, or an estate for life or for
years, the court may by its order authorize the special guardian of suchb
infant, or the guardian of such incompetent person, to join with the
person holding the reversionary estate in a conveyance of the property to
which such interest attaches, so as to release such right or dower, or
fully convey the particular estate, on receiving from the proceed? of

Section S626. The following rules of pleading and proceeding shall

(2) the answer of the defendant.

shall be entered by the justice in his docket; if in writing, they shall
be filed by him, and a reference to tliein made in the docket.
3. The complaint shall state, in a plain and direct manner, the facts
constituting the cause of action.
4. The answer may contain a denial of the complaint, or of any part
thereof, and also notice, in a plain and direct manner, of any facts con
stituting a defense. The pendency of an action commenced by the
ordinary summons, shall not be pleaded in abatement of an action com
menced by summons returnable in three days, or by warrant.
5. Pleadings are not required to be in any particular form, but must
be such as to enable a person of common understanding to know what
is intended.
6. Either party may demur to a pleading of his adversary, or any
part thereof, where it is not sufficiently explicit to enable him to under
stand it, or it contains no cause of action or defense although it betaken
as true.
7. If the court deem the objection well founded, it shall order the
pleading to be amended, and if the party refuse to amend, the defective
pleading shall be disregarded.
8. In case a defendant does not appear and answer, the plaintiff can
not recover without proving his case, except in cases provided by law.
9. In an action or defense, fonnded upon an account or instrument
for the payment of money only, it shall be sufficient for a party to de
liver the account or instrument to the court, and to state that there is
due him from the adverse party a specified sum, which he claims to re
cover or set off.
10. A variance between the proof on the trial, and the allegation in
a pleading shall be disregarded as immaterial, unless the court shall be
satisfied that the adverse party has been misled to his prejudice thereby.
11. The pleadings may be amended at any time before trial, or dur
ing the trial, when by such amendment substantial justice will be pro
moted. Any defendant who shall have failed to appear on the return
day of the process against him, if the action shall have been adjourned
by the plaintiff, may be permitted to answer on such adjourned day, if
he shall then appear and request so to do before trial. If an amend
ment be made after the joining of the issue, or an answer nut in after
adjournment, and it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court,
by oath, that an adjournment is necessary to the adverse party, in con
sequence of such amendment, an adjournment shall be granted. The
court may also, in its discretion, require, as a condition of an amendment,
the payment of costs to the adverse party, to be fixed by the
court; but no amendment shall be allowed after a witness is sworn on
a trial, when an adjournment thereby will be made necessary.
12. The court may, at the joining of issue, require either party at
the request of the other, at that or some other specified time, to exhibit
his account or demand, or state the nature thereof so far as may be in
his power, and in case of his default, preclude him from giving evidence
of such parts thereof as shall not have been so exhibited or stated.
Section 3627. At the time of joining issue in an action upon contract
or for the recovery of damages for an involuntary trespass, any
defendant may offer in writing to permit the plaintiff to take judgment
against him for the sum, damages or thing stated in said offer, with
costs; if the plaintiff accept such offer, he shall make such acceptance
in writing, and such offer and acceptance shall be filed with the justice;
and thereupon, if the justice shall be satisfied that the action was
brought in good faith, and without collusion of the parties thereto, for
the ascertainment of which he may examine the parties and witnesses
on oath, he shall enter judgment accordingly. The entry of such judg
ment shall not prejudice the right of the plaintiff to proceed to trial
and judgment against any other defendants in said action.
Section 3628. If the plaintiff do not accept such offer it shall be
deemed withdrawn, and shall not be considered in any manner or for
any purpose by the justice or jury before whom the action is tried ; but
if the plaintiff fail to recover a more favorable judgment than he would
have done by accepting the offer, he shall not recover costs made after
the making such offer, but shall pay costs so made to the defendant.

the application of a party, unless such party shall satisfy the justice bv

the same, (setting forth what diligence has boen used), and that he be
lieves if an adjournment be allowed, he will be able to procure such
testimony, or witness in time to be used upon the trial.
Section 3632. Every adjournment shall he for such reasonable time,

cause shall be proceeded in and tried upon the issue formed by the affi-
davit and answer, as in other actions commenced by summons; and if
upon the trial of any such issue, property or effects shall be found in

Jiis possession belonging to the defendant, or that he was indebted h
him, the justice shall enter an order in his docket, requiring the gar
nishee, witliin ten days, to pay or deliver to the justice such property or
the amount of such indebtedness, or so much thereof as may be neces
sary to satisfy such judgment; or if it appeal's from such answer or
finding that the garnishee is to pay or deliver to the defendant any
money or property in any other manner or at any other time than im

such payment or delivery be so made to the justice for the benefit of
the plaintiff. If such garnishee shall pay such indebtedness and de
liver such property as directed by such order, the costs of the gar
nishee shall be paid out of the money or property received by the jus
tice, unless the garnishee upon an issue joined with him by the plaint
iff shall have been held liable in a greater amount of property or

justice, touching his liabilities as garnishee, the justice shall enter snch
fact in his docket and he shall be adjudged to be indebted to the
defendant; and if judgment shall be rendered in favor of the plaintiff
against the defendant, judgment in favor of the plaintiff shall be entered
against such garnishee for the amount of the judgment against the
defendant and for all costs in the garnishee proceeding, and no snci
costs shall be paid by the defendant; or on demand of the plaintiff h
may issue a warrant to arrest the garnishee, which shall be served it
the same manner as warrants issued by justices of the peace in civil
actions founded on tort, and the garnishee shall be held thereon until
he shall make full and direct answers to such interrogatories; and the
justice may continue the cause to some other day, if necessary, for further
proceedings.
Section 3729. If the garnishee shall have failed to appear at the

of any mortgage of real estate, shall die without having foreclosed the
right of redemption, all the interest in the mortgaged premises conveyed
t. 1 jiji_ ii iiiit -i 1
by such mortgage, and the debt secured thereby, shall be considered as
personal assets in the hands of the executor or administrator, and he
may foreclose the same, and have any other remedy for the collection
of such debt, which the deceased could have had if living, or may con
tinue any proceeding commenced by the deceased for that purpose.
Section 3830. In case of the redemption of any such mortgage, or
the sale of the mortgaged premises by virtue of a power of 6ale con-
tained therein, or otherwise, the money paid thereon shall be received
by the executor or administrator, and he shall thereupon give all
necessary releases and receipts; and if upon the sale of the mortgaged
premises the same shall be bid in by the executor or administrator
for such debt, he shall be seized of the 6ame for the same persons,
whether creditors, next of kin, or others, who would have been enti

deeds or conveyances are void as against creditors, the executor or8
administrator may and it shall be his duty to commence and proseecu
te to final judgment any proper action for the recoveiy of the
same, and may recover for the benefit of the creditors all such real
estate so fraudulently conveyed, and may also, for the benefit of

three thousand eight hundred and thirty two, shall be sold for the pay-
ment of debts, in the same manner as if the deceased had died seized
thereof, upon obtaining license therefor from the county court; and

aforesaid shall be appropriated to pay the debts of the deceased, in the
same manner as other assets in the hands of the executor or admin
istrator.
Section 3835. Whenever there shall be just reason to apprehend
thct the estate of a deceased person, as set forth in the inventory re-
turned into court by his executor or administrator, may be insufficient

have been allowed by the county court or commissioners appointed by
said court, may, on behalf of all, bring an action in the circuit court,

Section 3836. Such creditor's action shall not be brought to trial
' until the sufficiency or the insufficiency of the estate in the hands of
the executor or administrator to pay the debts of the deceased shall be
ascertained; if found sufficient, such action shall be dismissed at the
cost of the plaintiff; if found insufficient, such action may proceed to
trial and judgment, and any property described in the complaint which
ought, by law, to be subjected to the payment of the debts of the de
ceased, shall be sold under the order of such circuit court; and the

shall be requested by all the heirs residing in this state; or the court
may order 6uch personal property to be sold at public or private sale
as the executor or administrator may find most beneficial. If the
order be to sell at auction, the court 6hall direct the mode of giving
notice of the time and place of sale.
CHAPTER CLXV.
OF THE PROOF AND PAYMENT OF DEBTS AND LEGACIES.
Section 3S38. On granting letters testamentary or of administration
by any county court, it shall be the duty of such court to receive,
examine and adjust the claims and demands of all persons against the
deceased ; but such court may, in its discretion, upon the application of
the executor or administrator, or of any party in interest, appoint not
exceeding three suitable persons to be commissioners to receive, exam-
ine and adjust such claims and demands, whenever it shall appear
probable to said court that such claims or demands, in the aggregate,
exceed five hundred dollars, and that there are assets amounting to
that sum that ought, under existing laws, to be applied to the payment
of debts.
Section 3839. The county court shall appoint convenient times
aQd places when and where the court, or commissioners, will receive,
examine and adjust such claims, and within sixty days after granting
letters testamentary or of administration, snail give notice of the timea
and places fixed for that purpose, and of the time limited for creditors
to present their claims, by causing a notice thereof to be published
in a newspaper as provided in section four thousand and forty tire,
for four successive weeks, or in such other manner as the court ma*"
direct. The first publication, if any, shall be within ten days after
making the order. The commissioners shall have power to adjourn
to any other time or place as circumstances may require. They shall
be sworn to a faithful discharge of their duty, ana any one of them
shall have power to administer oaths to parties and witnesses in mat
ters on trial before them. If any commissioner shall at any time
die, remove out of the state, refuse, or become in any way in.capaci-
tatcd to perform his duties as such, the court may appoint another in
his place.
Section 3840. The county court shall allow such time as the circnmstances
of the case shall require for the creditors to present their
claims for examination and allowance, which time shall not in the first
instance exceed one year nor be less than six months. Such time may
be enlarged or extended before, or within two months after, the expiration
of the time previously limited has expired, for good cause shown,
upon application of a creditor upon reasonable notice to the executor
or administrator, if any, and otherwise to such parties in interest as the
court shall direct, but not so that the whole time will exceed two years
from the time of granting letters testamentary or of administration;
such claim shall be heard by the court or commissioners as the court
shall direct
Section 3841. When a creditor against whom the deceased had
claims shall present a claim to the county court or commissioners, the
executor or administrator shall exhibit the claims of the deceased in offset
to the claims of the creditor, and the court or commissioners shall
ascertain and allow the balance against or in favor of the estate as the
same shall be found; but no claim barred by the statute of limitations
sliall be allowed by the court or commissioners in favor of or against
the estate, as a setoff or otherwise.
Section 3S42. At the expiration of the time limited for creditors
to present their claims against the deceased, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the court or commissioners shall in writing make a state
ment embracing lists of the claims presented against the deceased,
and those exhibited in offset, and stating how much was allowed
and how much disallowed in each case, together with the final bal
ance, whether in favor of the creditor or the estate ; and the same shall
be recorded and stand as the judgment of the court. If the balance
is in favor of the estate, the collection thereof may be enforced by
execution.
Section 3843. The court or commissioners shall have power to try
And decide upon all claims which by law survive against or in favor of
executors and administrators, except claims for the possession of or title
to real estate, and may examine and allow all demands at the then
present value thereof, which may be payable at a future day, including
claims payable in specific articles, and may offset such demands in the
same manner in favor of the estate; but this shall not prevent any
, . . . .' , , 1-1111, 11
executor or administrator from paying any debts which sliall be payable
at a future day, according to the terms and at the time specified in the
contract.
Section 3844. Every person having a claim against a deceased per-
son, proper to be allowed by the court or commissioners, who shall not,
ufter notice given as required by section three thousand eight hun-
■Ired and thirty nine, exhibit his claim to the court or commissioners
within the time limited for that purpose, shall be forever barred from
recovering such demand, or from setting off the same in any action
whatever.
Section 3845. No action shall be commenced against an executor
or administrator, excepting actions for the recovery of specific real or
personal property, or actions to establish, enforce or foreclose a lien
or right of lien on real or personal property. Nor shall any attachment
or execution be issued against the estate, of the deceased, or the execu
tor or administrator thereof, until the expiration of the time limited
for the payment of debts, except as provided in sections two thousand
seven hundred and fifty one and two thousand nine hundred and
seventy eight. Nothing in this section shall prevent any person hav
ing a lawful claim against a deceased person from bringing an action
therefor against the executor, administrator, heir, devisee or legatee of
such deceased person, when no time has been fixed in which creditors
may present their claims against the deceased for allowance, or when no
notice of snch limitation has been ordered or given.
Section 3846. All actions which may be pending against a deceased
person at the time of his death, may, if the cause of action survive, be
prosecuted to final judgment, and the executor or administrator may be
admitted to defend the same, as provided in chapter one hundred and
twenty seven. If any judgment shall be rendered against the executor
or administrator, the court rendering it shall certify the same to the
county court; and the amount thereof shall be paid in the same manner
as other claims duly allowed against the estate, except as provided in the
preceding section.
Section 3S47. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent
executor or administrator from commencing and prosecuting anyac-
tion against any other person, or from prosecuting any action commenced
by the deceased in his lifetime, for the recovery of any debt or claim, to
final judgment, or from having execution on any judgment. In such
case the defendant may set oft any claim he may have against the de
ceased, instead of presenting it to the court or commissioners, and all
mutual claims may be setoff in such action. If judgment shall beren^ere£
jn favor 0f tiie defendant, the same shall be certified by the court
rendering it to the county court, and be considered the true balance, and
paid as other claims allowed against the estate.
Section 3848. When two or more persons shall be indebted on any
joint contract, or upon a judgment founded on a joint contract, and either
of them shall die, his estate shall be liable therefor, and the claim may
be allowed by the court or commissioners as if the contract had been
joint and several, or as if the judgment had been against him alone, and
the other parties to such joint contract may be compelled to contribute
or to pay the same, if they would have been liable to do so upon payment
thereof by the deceased,
Section 3849. "Within sixty days after the expiration of the time
,. . . . ... .«., / , . r j ■ ■
limited for creditors to present their claims, every executor or adminis
trator shall render an account of his administration to the county court,
and such court shall thereupon direct the executor or administrator to
proceed forthwith to the payment of the debts, and to a final settlement
of the estate, in the manner prescribed by law, unless it shall satisfactorily
appear to the court:
1. That the personal assets in the hands of the executor or adminis
trator are insufficient to pay the debts of the deceased, and that there is
reaj estate that can be mortgaged, leased or sold to pay such debts;
2. That an appeal has been taken from some action of the county court
or commissioners, which is still pending, and necessarily delays the set
tlement of the estate;
3. That collectible debts due the estate have not been collected ;
4. That a contingent claim has been allowed against the estate of the
deceased and that the final settlement of the estate is necessarily delayed
thereby; or
5. That some other good and sufficient cause for delay exists.
Section 3850. Whenever it shall satisfactorily appear to the county
court that any one or more of the causes for delay mentioned in the
preceding section exists, such court shall, by order, fix a time within
which the executor or administrator shall pay the debts and legacies
and make a final settlement of the estate and of his account as executor
or administrator; but such time shall in no case exceed twelve months,
except when granted upon the petition of the executor or administrator,
under oath, setting forth the assets remaining in his possession belong
ing to the estate of the deceased, the debts and legacies that remain
unpaid, the reasons why the delay in the settlement of the estate prayed
for is necessary, and what additional time is deemed requisite for a full
settlement of such estate, and upon notice to all parties interested of
the time and place of hearing such petition, given by publication for
three successive weeks before the day of hearing in a newspaper, as
provided in section four thousand and forty five, or in such other man
ner as the court may direct. On such hearing the court may in its
discretion grant such further time for the payment of the debts and
legacies and the settlement of the estate, as the nature of the case may
require, and may again extend the time upon like petition and notice;
but in no case shall the time be extended beyond six years from the
time of granting letters testamentary or of administration.
Section 3851. When an executor or administrator shall die or
become incapable of discharging his trust, and another administrator
of the same estate shall be appointed, the county court may for cause
shown, without notice, extend the time for the payment of the debts and
legacies and the settlement of the estate for six" months beyond the
time allowed the original executor or administrator, and may extend
the time for a longer period upon petition and notice, as required in the
preceding section; but in no case shall the extended time exceed six
months beyond the time limited in the preceding section.
PAYMENT OF DEBTS.
Section 3852. If, after the amount of the claims against any estate shall
have been ascertained by the court or commissioners, it shall appear that
the executor or administrator has in his possession sufficient to pay all
the debts, he shall pay the same in full within the time limited for that
purpose. If the assets received by the executor or administrator, and
which can be appropriated to the payment of debts, shall not be suf
ficient, he shall, after paying necessary expenses of administration, pay
the debts against the estate in the following order:
1. The necessary' funeral expenses;
2. The expenses of the last sickness;
3. Debts having a preference under the laws of the United States;
4. Debts due to other creditors.
If there shall not be assets enough to pay all the debts of any one
class, each creditor shall Ise paid a dividend in proportion to his claim;
and no creditor of any one class shall receive any payment until all of
those of the preceding class shall be fully paid.
Section 3853. After the time limited for creditors to present their
claims has expired, and the amount of the indebtedness of the deceased
has been ascertained by the court or commissioners, such court shall
make an order or judgment for the payment of the debts of the
deceased, in whole or in part, out of the assets in the hands of the
executor or administrator for that purpose, as the circumstances of the
estate shall require.
Section 3851. If an appeal shall be taken from the decision of the
cour(. or commissioners in respect to any claim and shall remain unde
termined, the county court may suspend the order or judgment for the
payment of debts mentioned in the preceding section, or may order the
payment in whole or in part, of the claims that have been allowed and
from which no appeal has been taken, leaving in the hands of the eiecutor,
or administrator, sufficient assets to make a like payment upon
the claims disputed and pending upon appeal. When the disputed
claims shall have been finally settled, the county court shall order the
same to be paid out of the assets retained, to the same extent, and in
the same proportion as the claims of the other creditors.
Section 3S55. If the whole of the debts shall not have been paid in
full under the first order or judgment of the court for that purpose,
and if the whole assets applicable thereto shall not have been used, or if
other assets shall afterward come to the hands of the executor or admin
istrator that ought to be used in paying debts, the court may from time
to time, according to the circumstances of the case, make further orders
or judgments for the payment of the debts.
Section 3856. Whenever an order or judgment shall have been
made by the county court, for the payment of the debts in whole or in
part, the executor or administrator after the time fixed for the pay-
merit shall arrive, shall be personally liable to the creditors for their
debts or the dividend thereon, as for his own debt; and he shall be
liable on his bond, and the same may be put in action on the applica
tion of a creditor whose debt or dividend shall not be paid as above
mentioned.
Section 3857. When the time for paying the debts of a deceased
person shall be finally limited by order of the county court, whether the
estate be solvent or insolvent, the court may on the application of the
executor or administrator, by order, cause notice to be given to the cred
itors of the time fixed for the payment of such debts, by publication in a
newspaper as provided in section four thousand and forty five, for three
successive weeks, or in such other manner as the court may direct If,
after such notice shall have been given, any creditor shall neglect to
demand from the executor or administrator his debt or the dividend
thereon, within two years from the time so limited for the payment of
debts, or if the notice shall be given after such time, within two years
from the last publication, the claim of such creditor shall be forever
barred.
CONTINGENT CLAIMS.
Section 3S58. If any person shall be liable as security for the deceased,
or have any other contingent claim against his estate which cannot
be proved as a debt before the court or commissioners, or allowed
by them, the same may be presented with the proper proof totiie court
or commissioners, and they shall embrace the same in a statement as
provided in section three thousand eight hundred and forty two. If
the court shall be satisfied by the proof exhibited, it may order the ex
ecutor or administrator to retain in his hands sufficient estate to i«y
such contingent claim, when the same shall become absolute: or if the
estate shall be insolvent, sufficient to pay a percentage thereof equal to
the dividends of the other creditors.
Section 3S59. If such contingent claim shall become absolute, and
shall be presented to the county court at any time witliin two yesiri
from the time limited for other creditors to present their claims, it may
be allowed by such court upon due proof, in the same manner as other
claims presented for allowance within the time limited for that purpose.
If such contingent claim shall be allowed as herein provided, or estab
lished on appeal, the creditor shall be entitled to receive payment there
on to the same extent as other creditors, if the estate retained by the
executor or administrator shall be sufficient for that purpose.
Section 3860. If the claim of any person shall accrue, or become
absolute at any time after the time limited for creditors to present their
claims, the person having such claim may present it to the county
court, and prove the same, at any time within one year after it shall
accrue or become absolute, and if established in the manner provided
in this chapter, the executor or administrator shall be required to pay
it, if lie shall have sufficient assets for that purpose, and shall be re
quired to pay such part as he shall have assets to pay; and if real or
personal estate shall afterward come to his possession, he shall be
required to pay such claim, or such part thereof as he may have assets
sufficient to pay, not exceeding the proportions of other creditors, in
such time as the county court may prescribe.
Section 3861. When a claim shall be presented within one year
from the time when it shall accrue, and be established as mentioned in
the preceding section, and the executor or administrator shall not have
sufficient assets to pay the whole of such claim, the creditor shall have
a right to recover such part of his claim, as the executor or administra
tor has not assets to pay, against the heirs, devisees or legatees who
shall have received sufficient real and personal property from the estate
that was liable for the payment of the debts of the deceased.
Section 3862. All the estate of the testator or intestate, real and
personal, except the homestead of the deceased and the property dis-
posed of under the provisions of section three thousand nine hundred
and thirty five, shall be liable to be disposed of for the payment of his
debts and the expenses of administering his estate; but if a testator
shall make provision by his will, or designate therein the estate to be
appropriated for the payment of his debts, the expenses of administra
tion or family expenses, they shall be paid accordingly, and out of the
estate thus appropriated, so far as the same may be sufficient; but no
general direction in any will to pay the debts of the testator out of his
property shall subject the homestead to the payment thereof.
Section 38G3. If the provisions made by the will or the estate
appropriated shall not be sufficient to pay the debts, expenses of admin-
istration, and family expenses, such part of the estate, real or personal,
as shall not have been disposed of by the will, if any, shall be first appro
priated as provided by law for that purpose.
Section 3S64. The estate, real and personal, given by will to any
devisees or legatees, when required for that purpose, shall be held liable
for the payment of debts, expenses of administration, and family ex
penses, in proportion to the amount of the several devises or legacies;
except that specific devises and legacies, and the person to whom they
shall be made, may be exempted if there shall be other sufficient estate,
and it shall appear to the court necessary in order to carry into effect
the intention of the testator.
Section 3805. "When the estate given by any will shall be fiable for
the payment of debts and expenses as mentioned in the preceding sec-
tion, or is liable to be taken to make up the share of a child born after
the execution of the will, or of a child or the issue of a child not pro-
vided for in the will, as provided in sections two thousand two hundred
and eighty six, two thousand two hundred and eighty seven, and two
"thousand two hundred and eighty eight, the executor shall have the
right to retain the possession of the same until such liability shall be
settled by order of the county court, and until the devises and lega
cies so liable shall be accordingly assigned by order of such court; and
when the same can be properly done, any devisee or legatee may make
his claim to such court to have such liability settled, and his devise or
legacy assigned to him.
Section 3866. All the devisees or legatees who shall, with the oonsent
of the executor or otherwise, have possession of the estate given to
them by will, before such liability shall be settled by the county court,
shall hold the same subject to the several liabilities mentioned in the
preceding section, and shall be held to contribute, according to their
respective liabilities, to the executor or to any devises or legatee from
whom the estate devised or bequeathed to him may have been token
for the payment of debts or expenses, or to make up the share of i
child born after the making of the will, or of a child or the issue of a
child omitted in the will; and the persons who may, as heirs, have re
ceived the estate, not disposed of by will, shall be liable to contribute
among themselves in like manner as the devisees or legatees.
Section 3867. If any person liable to contribute according to the
provjs;ong 0f tne preceding section, shall be insolvent aud unable to pay
his share, the others shall be severally liable for the loss occasioned by
such insolvency, in proportion to, and to the extent of, the estate they
may have received; and if any of the persons so liable to contribute
shall die before having paid his share, the claim shall be valid against
his estate, in the same manner as if it had been his proper debt.
Section 3868. The county court may, by judgment for that purpose,
settle the amount of the several liabilities as provided in the pre
ceding sections, and adjudge how much and in what manner, each per
son shall contribute, and may issue execution to enforce its judgment
as circumstances may require. The claimant may also have a remedy
by any proper action.

OF THE ASSIGNMENT OF DOWER AND HOMESTEADS.
Section 3869. When a widow is entitled to dower in lands of which
jjer ]llisband died seized, and her right to dower is not disputed by the

the county court for the county in which the estate of her husband is
being settled, upon petition of the widow or any other person inter
ested in the lands. Notice of the time and place of hearing such peti
tion, shall be given to such heirs, devisees or other persons, in such
manner as said court shall direct.
Section 3S70. For the purpose of assigning such dower, the county
court shall issue its warrant to three discreet and disinterested person;-.

commissioners shall be sworn to the faithful discharge of their duties
and as soon as practicable shall set off the dower according to the command
of such warrant, and mate retnrn of their doings, with an ac
count of their charges and expenses, in writing, to the county court;
and the same being approved and recorded, and an attested copy thereof
recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county where the
lands are situated, the dower shall remain fixed and certain, unless such
approval be set aside or reversed on appeal. One-half of the costs of
such proceedings shall be paid by the widow, and the other half by the
adverse party.
Section 3871. When the estate out of which dower is to be assigned
consists of a mill or other tenement, which cannot be divided
without damage to the whole, and in all cases where the estate cannot
be divided by metes and bounds, the dower may be assigned of the
rents, issues and profits thereof, to be had and received by the widow
as a tenant in common with the other owners of the estate.
Section 3872. When a widow is entitled to dower in land of which
her husband died seized, she may continue to occupy the same, with
the children or other heirs of the deceased, or may receive one-third
part of the rents, issues and profits thereof, so long as the heirs or others
interested do not object, without having the dower assigned.
HOMESTEADS.
Section 3873. When a widow, heir or" devisee is entitled to the
homestead of which her husband, the testator or intestate, died seized,
and the right of the widow, heir or devisee thereto is not disputed by

of them, and the widow, heirs, devisees and the creditors or other per
sons in interest are unable to agree as to the limits and boundaries
thereof, the same may be assigned to the widow, heir or devisee in the
same manner and with like effect, and upon like notice and proceed
ings, that are required by this chapter upon the assignment or dower,
and the costs shall be paid in the same manner.
CHAPTER CLXVII.
OF THE SALE OF LANDS BY EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS.
Section 3874. When the personal estate of any deceased person, in
the hands of his executor or administrator, shall be insufficient to pay

in the manner provided in this chapter.
Section 3875. In order to obtain such license, the executor or ad-
mi'nistrator shall present a petition, verified by himself, to the county

estate in the hands of the executor or administrator is insufficient to
pay the debts of the deceased and expenses of administration, and thai
'* is necessary to sell or incumber the whole or part of the real estate
for the payment of such debts and expenses, the county court shall

of such minor for the sole purpose of appearing for him and tak
ing care of his interest in the proceedings, and the service of all order?
and notices shall be made on such special guardian. If such minor
shall have a general guardian in the county, such general guardisj
shall appear and take care of the interest of such minor, and all orders
and notices, required to be served, shall be served on such gener.t
guardian.
Seotion 3879. The county court at the time and place appointed re
order, or at such oilier time and place as the hearing shall h
adjourned to, upon proof of the due service and publication of snch
order or notice or upon filing the consent in writing to such mortgage,
lease or sale, of all the persons interested, shall proceed to the hearing
on such petition, and if such consent be not filed, shall hear and exam
ine the allegations and proofs of the petitioner, and all persons inter
ested in the estate who shall think proper to oppose the application.
The parties and witnesses may be examined on either side,
Section 3SS0. If on such hearing, it shall appear to the court, that
^ie heirs or devisees of the real estate in question, or any person claim
ing under them wish to contest the validity of any debt or claim
which may be represented as existing against the testator or intestate,
he shall be allowed to do so and to set up the statute of limitations in
bar of such claim; and the admission of any such claims, so barred, br
an executor or administrator, shall not be deemed to revive the same,
so as in any way to affect the real estate of said deceased; and t'ie
hearing on such petition shall be postponed until the liability of the
estate for such claim is finally determined,
Section 3S81. The court shall make no order for the mortgaging
leasing or sale of the real property of the deceased, until upon examin*
tion it shall appear to said court:
j 'pjiat t]ie executor or administrator making such application tai
fully complied with the preceding provisions of this chapter;
2. That the debts, for the purpose of satisfying which the application
is made, are justly due and owing;
3. That the personal estate of the deceased is insufficient for the pay
ment of such debts.
Section 3882. "When the facts mentioned in the preceding section,
shall be established to the satisfaction of the county court, said court shall
nest ascertain whether sufficient money to pay such debts can be raised
by mortgaging or leasing the real property of the deceased or any part
thereof. If it appear that money can be so raised advantageously to such
estate, the court shall direct a mortgage or lease to be made for that pur
pose. No lease shall be made for the purpose aforesaid, unless some of
the persons interested in the real estate of the deceased to be leased, shall
be under the age of twenty one years ; nor shall such lease be for a longer
time than until the youngest person, interested in the real estate leased,
shall have become twenty one years of age. Such lease or mortgage,
when made as aforesaid, shall be as valid and effectual as if executed by
the testator or intestate while in life.
Section 3883. If it shall appear to the county court that the money
required cannot be raised by mortgage or lease, advantageously to the"
estate, the court shall make an order authorizing the executor or administr.itor
to sell so much of the real estate of the testator or intestate a8H
shall he sufficient to pay the debts left unpaid afrer the personal estate
of the deceased is exhausted; but no order shall be made for mortgag
ing, leasing or selling the homestead, except as provided in the next section.
Section 3884. Whenever the homestead of the deceased is part only
of a tract of land, the whole of which was subject to a mortgage at the
time of the death of the deceased, and it shall appear that all other real
estate and personal'property of the deceased has been applied to the pay
ment of his debts, or is insufficient therefor, and that the part of the
mortgaged premises not included in the homestead cannot be sold sepa
rately therefrom, without injury to the interests of the parties, the court
may grant a license for the sale of the whole of the tract; or if a part
of the tract can be sold separately, and only a part is necessary to be
sold in connection with the homestead to prevent such injury, then a
license to sell such part separately first, which can be so separately sold,
and the remainder afterwards, may be granted. The order of license,
in either case, shall direct that the entire estate or interest, including the
interest of the mortgagee, be so sold; but no such license to sell shall
be made when the mortgage debt is not wholly due, unless the mort
gagee shall consent in writing thereto; and when the mortgage debt
shall be due, no sale shall be made under any such license for a less
sum than the amount of such mortgage debt, with interest and costs of
sale, unless the mortgagee shall consent thereto in writing, and release
his mortgage thereon.
The proceeds of the sale shall, under the direction of the court, be
applied in the following order:
"I. The expenses of the license and sale shall be paid;
2. The mortgage debt, making a proper rebate of interest on any sum
not due, shall next be paid;
3. The court shall next ascertain and set apart the value of the home
stead sold, irrespective of the mortgage thereon;
4. If there be any residue of the proceeds remaining, the same shall
be applied to the payment of debts, as in other cases.
The sum set apart, as the value of the homestead, shall be paid to
the owners thereof, by descent or devise, unless such owners, or some of
them, be minors, in which case the court may, if it co.n be justly done,
separate the amount belonging to such minors and pay the same to their
guardian, and pay the amount belonging to any person of full age to
such person ; or if such separation or the funds cannot be made will
certainty and with justice to the interests of such minors, the court msj
order the whole invested until such minors reach majority, or such sep
aration of the fund can be made and meantime apply the income frok
such investment to the use of the persons entitled thereto, according D.
their rights and interests therein. The proceeds of such homestc*:
shall possess all the privileges and exemptions which appertained t?
law to the homestead before such sale.
Section 3885. "Whenever an order shall be made by the county
court for the sale of any real estate for the payment of the debts of the
deceased and charges of administration, and such real estate shall be
to the rijdit of dower in the widow, it shall be lawful for the
executor or administrator to enter into a contract in writing with the
widow, by which she may agree to accept in lieu of dower such a per
centage on the amount realized on the sale as shall be deemed, upon the
principles of law applicable to annuities, a reasonable satisfaction for
such dower; which said contract shall be sealed and witnessed by two
witnesses, and filed with the county court, together with an affidavit
setting forth the age of the widow. The said contract, when acknowl-
edged and assented to by said widow before the county court, and ap
proved by said court, and the acknowledgment indorsed thereon,' shall
operate as a release of the dower right of the widow, in the real estate.
and the same shall be sold free from all claim of dower. Immediate!;
after the sale, so ordered, shall have been made, the executor or 10-
ministrator shall file with the county court the receipt of the widow for
the said percentage taken in lieu of dower, or he shall deposit the same
amount with the county court for her use, to be paid to her when she
indorses a receipt for the same on said contract.
Section 3S86. No license to mortgage, lease or sell real estate shall
De granted, if any person interested in the estate shall give bonds to the
judge of the county court, in such sum and with such sureties as he
shall direct and approve, with condition to pay all the debts and the
expenses of administration, so far as the goods and chattels, rights ar/1
credits of the deceased shall be insufficient therefor, within such time
as the county court shall direct. Such bond shall be for the seenritj,
and may be prosecuted for the benefit, of the creditors as well as tie
executor or administrator.
Section 3887. "When the executor or administrator is authorized to
mortgage, lease or sell any real estate for the payment of debts, he stall,
before the sale, give bond to the judge of the county court, with suffi
cient sureties, to account for all the proceeds of the sale, and to dispose
of the same according to law, and take and subscribe the oath prescribed
by section three thousand nine hundred and fifteen.
Section 3888. The order shall specify the hinds to be sold, and the
count.Y court may therein direct the order in which several parcels shall
be sold. If it appear that any part of such real estate, or any estateori
interest therein, has been devised, and not charged in such devise will
the payment of debts, the count}' court shall order that part not devi*i
to be first sold; and if it appear that any lands devise! or descends
have been sold by the devisees or heirs, then the lands remaining unsok
shall be ordered to be sold first.
Section 3S89. Upon making such order for the mortgaging, leas
ing or selling real estate, and filing with the county court a bond*
required by this chapter, a certified copy of such order shall be delivered
by the court to the executor or administrator, who shall there-
upon be authorized to mortgage, lease or sell the real estate as therein
directed, within one year after making the order and not after that
period. But the court making the order may, on application of the
executor or administrator, and for good cause shown, extend the time
for making a sale of real estate, but not longer than two years after the
date of the original order.
Section 3890. License to sell real estate as provided in this chapter
nay extend to the reversion of the dower of the widow of a deceased
person; and if such reversion be not sold with the other real estate, it
nay be sold after the expiration of the widow's term.
Section 3S91. "When a sale is ordered, notice of the time and place
of holding the same shall be posted in three of the most public places
in the town or ward in which the land is situated, and shall be pub-
lished in a newspaper as provided in section four thousand and forty
five, for three successive weeks before the day fixed for the sale, and
the last publication shall not be more than ten days before such day,
in which notice the lands to be sold shall be described with reasonable
certainty.
Section 3892. Such sale shall be in the county where the lands
are situated, at public auction, between the hours of nine o'clock in the
norning and the setting of the sun of the same day. But where theN
lands are adjacent and lie in two or more counties, the sale may be had
in either, but the court shall by order designate in which; and if there
be a newspaper printed in more than one ot said counties, the court shall
direct in which of such newspapers the notice of sale shall be published,
and when so published, it shall be sufficient.
Section 3893. An affidavit of the executor, administrator, or any
other person having knowledge of the fact, that notice of any such sale
was given as provided in this chapter, filed in the county court, together
with a copy of the notice, shall be admitted as evidence of the time,
place and manner of giving such notice.
Section 3894. If at the time appointed for any such sale, the executor
or administrator shall deem it for the interest of all persons con
cerned therein, he may adjourn the same from time to time, not exceed
ing in all three months. In case of such adjournment, notice thereof
shall be given by a public declaration at the time and place first fixed
for the sale. If the adjournment shall be for more than one day,
further notice shall be given by posting or publishing the same, or
both, as the time and circumstances may admit.
Section 3895. On such sale, the executor or administrator may give
such length of credit, not exceeding three years, and for not more
than three-fourths of the purchase money, as shall seem best calculated
to produce the highest price, and as shall have been directed, or shall
be approved by the county court, and shall take such security for the
amount of the credit given upon the premises sold, as the court shall
direct and approve.
Section 3896". The executor or administrator making such sale
shall immediately thereafter make a return of his doings upon the
order of sale, in pursuance of which it was made, to the county court
granting the order. Said court shall examine the proceedings, and may
also examine the executor, administrator, or any other person, on oath,
touching the same. If such court shall be of the opinion that the pro
ceedings were unfair, or that the sum bid is disproportionate to the
value of the land sold, and that a sum exceeding such bid, exclusive
Jt
of the expense of a new sale, may be obtained, said court may vacate
such sale and direct another to be had, of which notice shall he given,
and the sale shall be in all respects conducted as if no previous sale
had taken place. If it shall appear to the county court that the sale
was legally made and fairly conducted, and that the sum bid thereon
was not disproportionate to the value of the property sold, or if dispro
portionate, that a greater sum as above specified cannot be obtained,
said court shall make an order confirming such sale and directing con
veyances to be executed.

four, shall be subject to all charges thereon by mortgage or otherwise,
existing at the time of the death of the testator or intestate, where suet
mortgage or charge is upon a single lot or tract of land. In case the
estate of the deceased shall be in any way liable for the amount secured
by any such mortgage, or for any such charge, such sale shall not be
confirmed by the county court, until the purchaser shall execute a bond
to the executor or administrator as required in section three thousand
nine hundred and one. But in case the charge by mortgage or other-
. . , ■. i * i j , • i xi
wise is upon two or more lots or parcels of land, greater in value than
the amount of said mortgage or liens thereon, the court ordering die sale,
on being satisfied that it would be most beneficial to the parties inter
ested in said land that the same be sold freed from such incumbrances,
may so order; in which case, sufficient of the moneys made by the sale
shall be appropriated or invested by order of the county court, on con
firming the sale, to pay and satisfy the said lien, and the balance that
may remain shall be applied in course of administration as assets in
the hands of the executor or administrator.
Section 3898. The proceeds arising from mortgage, lease or sale of
estate, or from the sale of the interest of any deceased person in
real estate held under contract, as provided in this chapter, shall be
deemed assets in the hands of the executor or administrator, in like
manner as if the same had been originally part of the goods and chat
tels of the deceased; and the executor or administrator, and the sure
ties in his administration bond, shall be accountable and liable therefor.
Section 3899. When a testator shall have given any legacy by a
^.jj ^^ .g eg-ectna] to p^g or cnarge real estate, and his goods, chat
tels, rights and credits shall be insufficient to pay such legacy, together
with the debts and charges of administration, the executor or adminis
trator with the will annexed, may be licensed to sell, mortgage or lease
his real estate for that purpose in the same manner and upon the same
terms and conditions, as are prescribed in this chapter in the case of i
sale, mortgage or lease for the payment of debts.

his last will, the same shall be applied and distributed as follows:
1. The widow, if any, shall be allowed all her articles of apparel and
ornaments, and all the wearing apparel and ornaments of the deceased.
the household furniture of the deceased, not exceeding in value two
hundred and fifty dollars, and other personal property to be selected by
her, not exceeding in value two hundred dollars. This allowance shall
be made when the widow waives the provision made for her in the will
of her husband, or when none is made for her, as well as when he dies
intestate.
2. The widow and minor children, or either, constituting the family
of the deceased testator or intestate, shall have such reasonable allowance
out of the personal estate, or the income of the real estate of the
deceased, as the county court shall judge necessary for their maintenance
during the progress of the settlement of the estate, but never for
a longer period than until their shares shall be assigned to them, and
in case of an insolvent estate, not longer than one year after granting
letters testamentary or of administration.
3. "When a person shall die, either testate or intestate, leaving children
under seven years of age, having no mother, or when the mother shall
die before the children shall arrive at the age of seven years, and before
the settlement of the estate, an allowance shall be made for the neces
sary maintenance of such children until they arrive at the age of seven
years, out of the personal estate, if sufficient; if not sufficient, then out
of the income of the real estate.
4. If on the return of the inventory of any estate it shall appear that
the value of the whole estate does not exceed the sum of one hundred
and fifty dollars in addition to the allowances mentioned in preceding
subdivisions of this section, the county court may by an order assign
the whole of such estate for the use and support of the widow and minor
children of the deceased, and for the support of the children under seven
years of age, if there ba no widow, after the payment of funeral charges
and expenses of administration.
5. Ii the personal estate of any deceased person shall amount to more
than one hundred and fifty dollars, in addition to the allowances men-

administration and funeral charges.

residue of the personal estate of a testator, not disposed of by his will,
and not required for the purposes hereinbefore mentioned in this sec-
i ii f i- -i i • i1 • iii
tion, shall be distributed in the same proportions, and to the same persons,
and for the same purposes, as prescribed for the descent and dispo-
6ition of real estate in chapter one hundred and two, except that when the
deceased shall leave a widow and lawful issue, the widow shall be entitled
to receive the same share of such residue as a child of such deceased.
7. Incase there shall be no known heir or distributee, the personal
estate not disposed of by the will shall belong to the state; and all the1"
personal estate of any deceased person, which shall not be claimed by
the legatee, heir or distributee, within three years after the death of the
owner thereof, shall in like manner belong to the state; subject in both
cases only to the debts, funeral charges, and the expenses of adminis
tration; and shall be paid to the state treasurer and become a part of
the school fund.
Section 303G. In all cases mentioned in the seventh subdivision of
the preceding section, it shall be the duty of the county court, having
jurisdiction thereof, to notify the attorney general of the interest, or
probable interest, of the state in such estate, immediately after the same
shall come to the knowledge of such court; and the attorney general
shall appear for and protect the interests of the state therein.
Section 3937. Tbe sum paid, by the representative of any estate
named in the seventh subdivision of section three thousand nine liun-
dred and thirty five, into the state treasury, shall be refunded to the
proper owner, who had not before asserted claim thereto, upon liis es
tablishing his right to the same as herein provided. Such claimant may,
at any time within five years after the payment of such sum into the
state treasury, file with the county court of the county where the estate
was settled a petition setting forth his right to the sum so paid to the
state treasury, and the grounds thereof; said court shall thereupon fix
a time and place for hearing such petition, and shall by order require
the claimant to notify the attorney general of the time and place so fixed
for such hearing, at least thirty days before such time. It shall be the
duty of the attorney general to appear for and protect the rights of the
state. When the claim is finally adjudicated by the county court, or
on appeal by the appellate court, if allowed, the county court shall so
certify to the secretary of state, who shall thereupon audit, and the state
treasurer shall pay the same; but no interest on the claim shall be paid
by the state.
Section 3938. If any land held by an executor or administrator as
inenti0ned in sections three thousand eight hundred and twenty nine,three thousand eight hundred and thirty and three thousand eight hun
dred and thirty one, shall not be sold by him as therein provided, it
shall be assigned and distributed to the same persons, and in the same
proportions, as if it had been part of the' personal estate of the deceased;
and if, upon such distribution, the estate shall come to two or more per
sons, partition thereof may be made between them in like manner, as if
it were real estate which the deceased held in his life time.
DISTRIBUTION AND PARTITION OF ESTATES.
Section 3939. Before any partition or division of any estate among
the heirs, devisees or legatees, an allowance shall be made for the neces-
sary expenses for the support of the children of the deceased under seven

expenses of administration, and after deducting all the allowances proviucd

county court shall, by an order or judgment, assign the residue of the
estate, if any, to such other persons as are by law entitled to the saint
In such order or judgment, the court shall name the persons and the
part to which each shall be entitled. Such persons shall have the right

or from any person having the same. Such order or judgment may
be made on the application of the executor or administrator, or of any
person interested in the estate.
Section 3941. No heir, devisee, legatee, or assignee thereof shall be
entitled to an order for his share, previous to the making of the order
or judgment mentioned in the preceding section, unless he shall give a

ties as the court may direct, to secure the payment of the just propor
tion of such heir, devisee or legatee, of such debts and expenses, or
such parts thereof as shall remain unprovided for, and to indemnify
the executor or administrator against the same.
Section 3942. When the county court shall make an order or judgmerit
assigning the residue of any estate to two or more persons entitled
to t'.ie same, it shall not be necessary to make partition or distribution
of such estate unless the parties to whom the assignment shall be made,
or some of them shall request it; but when requested by any party in
interest, partition and distribution may be made by three disinterested
persons to be appointed by the county court for that purpose. Said
court shall issue a warrant to them for the purpose of sucli partition and
distribution, and they shall be sworn to a faithful discharge of their
duties.
Section 3943. If the real estate shall lie in different counties, the
county court may appoint different commissioners for each county, and
in such case the estate in each county shall be divided separately, as if
there were no other estate to be divided; but unless otherwise directed
by the county court, the commissioners first appointed shall make divis
ion of all such real estate wherever situated in this state.
Section 3944. Before any commissioners shall be appointed to make
such partition and distribution as directed in this chapter, notice of the
time and place of hearing the application for the appointment of such
commissioners shall be given to all persons interested who reside in this

Section 3945. Partition of real estate may be made as provided in

should have been to such heirs or devisees.
Section 3946. Before any partition shall be made or any estate
divided, as provided in this chapter, guardians shall be appointed for
all minors and persons of unsound mind, interested in the estate to be
divided, and some discreet person shall be appointed to act as agent for
such parties as shall reside out of the state, and notice of the appointment
of such guardians and agents shall be given to the commissioners
in their warrant. Notice shall be given by the commissioners to all
persons interested in the partition, their guardians or agents, of the time
when and place where they will meet and proceed to make partition, in
such manner as the court shall direct.
Section 3947. The several shares in the real and personal estate
shall be set off to each individual, in proportion to his right, by metes
and bounds or descriptions, so that the same can be easily distin
guished, unless any two or more of the parties interested shall consent
to have their shares set off so as to be held by them in common and
undivided.
Section 3948. "When any tract of land, or tenement, shall be of
i i -i ,i I i j- -j j j

commissioners to either of the parties who will accept it, giving prefer
ence as prescribed in section three thousand nine hundred and fifty
one. But the party so accepting it shall pay or secure to one or more
of the others, such sums as the commissioners shall award to make the
partition equal, and the commissioners shall make their award accord

sums so awarded shall be paid to the parties entitled thereto, or secure!
to their satisfaction.

same, and such real estate shall be in common and undivided with the
real estate of any other person, the commissioners shall first divide and
sever the estate of the deceased from the estate with which it lies in
common, and such division, so made and established by the county
court, shall be binding on all the persons interested; but such other
part owner of such real estate shall have the same notice of the time
and place of hearing, upon the appointment of such commissioners, and
of the time and place of meeting to mate partition, as is provided in sec
tions three thousand nine hundred and forty four and three thousand
nine hundred and forty six.
Section 3950. The commissioners shall make report of their proceedings
to the county court, in writing; and the court may, for suffi
cient cause, set aside such report, and appoint other commissioners, or
direct the same commissioners to make another partition. The report,
when finally accepted and established, shall be recorded in the records
of the county court, and a copy thereof, attested by the judge of the
county court under the seal of the court, shall be recorded in the office
of the register of deeds of the county wherein the lands lie.
Section 3951. When any such real estate cannot be divided without
prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, the county court may
assign the whole to one or more of the parties entitled to share therein,
who will accept it, always preferring the males to the females, and
among children preferring the elder to the younger; but the party so
accepting the whole shall pay to the other parties interested their jnst
proportion of the true value thereof, or shall secure the same to their
satisfaction, and the true value of the estate shall be ascertained by com
missioners, appointed by the county court and sworn for that purpose.
Such commissioners shall only be appointed upon like notice to all par
ties interested, their guardians, agents and attorneys, as provided for
commissioners to make partition in sections three thousand nine hun
dred and forty four, and three thousand nine hundred and forty six.

an^ estate as provided in this chapter, the executor or admin istratoi
shall have retained sufficient effects in his hands which may be lawfully
applied for that purpose, the expenses of such partition or distribu
tion may be paid by such executor or administrator, when it shall ap
pear to the court just and equitable, and not inconsistent with the intent
of the testator; but if there be no effects in the hands of the executor
or administrator which may be lawfully applied to that purpose, the ex
penses and charges of the partition or distribution, being ascertained bv
the county court, shall be paid by all the parties interested in the parti
tion or distribution, in proportion to their respective shares or interests
in the premises; and the proportions shall be settled and determined by
the county court. If any one shall neglect to pay the sum assessed on
him by the court, the same may be enforced by execution in favor of
the persons entitled to the same.
Section 3954. When the term of a widow entitled to a homestead
right, or dower, or other life estate, in the lands of a deceased person, shall

this chapter, to any person residing out of this state, and having no
agent herein, and it shall be necessary that some person should be au
thorized to take possession and charge of the same, for the benefit of
such absent person, the court may appoint an agent for that purpose,
and authorize him to take charge of such estate, as well as to act for
snch absent person in the partition and distribution thereof. Such agent
shall give a bond to the judge of the county court, to be approved by
him, faithfully to manage and account for such estate, before he shall
be authorized to receive the same, and the court appointing such agent
may allow a reasonable sum out of the profits of the estate for his services
and expenses.
ADVANCEMENTS.
Section 3956. Any estate, real or personal, that may have been
given by the intestate in his lifetime as an advancement to any child, or
other lineal descendant, shall be considered as a part of the estate of the
intestate, so far as it regards the division and distribution thereof among
his issue, and shall be taken by such child or other descendant, toward
his share of the estate of the intestate.
Section 3957. If the amount of such advancement shall exceed the
share of the heir so advanced, he shall be excluded from any further por
tion in the division and distribution of the estate, but he shall not be
required to refund any part of such advancement; and if the amount
so received shall be less than his share, he shall be entitled to as much
more as will give him his full share of the estate of the deceased.
Section 3958. If such advancement be made in real estate, the value
thereof shall, for the purposes mentioned in the preceding section, be con-
sidered a part of the real estate to be divided ; and if it be in personal
estate it shall be considered as a part of the personal estate; if in
either case it shall exceed the share of real or personal estate respectively,
that would have come to the heir so advanced, he shall not be required
to refund any part of it, but shall receive so much less out of the other
part of the estate as will make his whole share equal to those of the
other heirs who are in the same degree with him.
Section 3959. All gifts and grants shall be deemed to have been
made in advancement, if they are expressed in the gift or grant to be
so made, or if charged in writing by the intestate as an advancement
cr acknowledged in writing as such by the child or other descendant.
If the value of the estate so advanced shall be expressed in the con
veyance, or in the charge thereof made by the intestate, or in the ac
knowledgment of the party receiving it, such value shall govern in the
division and distribution of the estate; otherwise it shall be estimated
according to its value when given, as nearly as the same can be ascer
tained.
Section 3960. If any child or other lineal descendant, so advanced,
shall die before the intestate, leaving issue, the advancement shall be
taken into consideration in the division and distribution of the estate;
and the amount thereof shall be allowed accordingly by the representa

been made directly to them.
Section 3901. All questions as to advancements made or alleged to
have been made by the deceased to any heirs, may be heard and deter-
mined by the county court, and shall be specified in the order or judg
ment assigning the estate, and in the warrant to the commissioners to
