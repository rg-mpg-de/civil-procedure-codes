CODE OF PRACTICE

IN

CIVIL CASES IN ARKANSAS.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas, as follows:

PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS.

SEC. 1. This act shall be known as the Code of Practice in Civil Cases in this State.

SEC. 2. Remedies in civil cases in this State are divided
into two classesFirst—Actions.

Second—Special Proceedings.

SEC. 3. A civil action is an ordinary proceeding in a
court of justice, by one party against another, for the enforcement or protection of a private right, or the redress or prevention of a private wrong. It may also be brought for the
recovery’ of a penalty or forfeiture.

SEC. 4. Every other remedy in a. civil case is a special
proceeding.

SEC. 1. The forms of all actions and suits, heretofore
existing, are abolished; and hereafter there shall be but one
form of actio11 for the enforcement or protection of private
rights, and the redress or prevention of private wrongs; which

shall be called a civil action.

SEC. 2. In such action the party complaining shall be
known as the plaintiff, and the adverse party as the defendant.

SEC. 3. The proceedings in a civil action may be of two
kinds:

First. At law.

Second. In equity.

SEC. 4. The plaintiff may prosecute his action by equitable proceedings in all cases, where Courts of Chancery,
before the adoption of this Code, had jurisdiction ; and must
so proceed in all cases where such jurisdiction was exclusive.

SEC. 5. In all other cases the plaintiff must prosecute

his action by proceedings at law.

SEC. 6. An action upon a written obligation or judgment, which has been lost or destroyed, may be prosecuted by

proceedings at law.

SEC. 7. An error of the plaintiff as to the kind of proceedings adopted, shall not cause the abatement or dismissal of
the action, but merely a change into the proper proceedings
by an amendment in the pleadings, and a transfer of the action

to the proper docket.

SEC. 8. The error mentioned in the last section may be
corrected by the plaintiff, without motion, at any time before
the defendant has answered; or afterward, on motion in court.

SEC. 9. The defendant shall be entitled to have the correction made in the following cases:

First. When the action has been commenced by equitable
proceedings, the defendant, by motion made at the time of
filing his answer, may have them changed into proceedings at
law, when it appears that by provisions of section five, the plaintiff should have adopted proceedings at law, unless his answer

presents an equitable defense.

Second. When the action has been commenced by proceedings at law, the defendant, by motion made at or before the
time of filing his answer, may have them changed into equitable
proceedings, when it appears that by the provisions of section
four, the plaintiff should have adopted proceedings in equity.

SEC. 10. Where the action has been properly commenced
by proceedings at law, either party shall have the right, by

motion, to have any issue, which, before the adoption of this
Code, was exclusively cognizable in chancery, tried in the manner hereinafter prescribed in cases of equitable proceedings;
and if all the issues are such as before the adoption of this
Code, were cognizable in chancery, though none were exclusively so, the defendant shall have the right to have them all
tried as in cases of proceedings in equity.

SEC. 11. If the plaintifi"s claim is for money due by contract, and the defendant puts in a defence of exclusively equitable cognizance, upon the plaintiff filing an affidavit that he
verily believes that he will succeed in the action, and that the
collection of his claim after judgment, will be endangered by
the delay arising from such defence being put in, the court
shall require the defendant to give security for the payment of
any judgment that the plaintiff may obtain in the action, and
upon his failure to give such security, shall order the defendant
to pay into court an amount sufiicient to discharge the plaintiff’s claim, and his probable costs; upon which order’ execution may be issued as upon a judgment, and the amount collected upon execution shall be brought into court and await
the decision of the action, and be paid to the plaintiff or defendant, according to such decision. But no such security shall
be required if the trial of the equitable defense takes place
during the term at which it is put in, nor until all defenses to
the action, other than those of equitable cognizance, are tried
or disposed of in favor of the plaintiff.

SEC. 12. An error as to the kind of proceedings adopted
in the action, is waived by failure to move for its correction at
the time and in the manner prescribed in this chapter, and all
errors in decisions of the court, on any of the motions named
in this chapter, are waived, unless excepted to at the time,
which may be done by the clerk noting at the end of such

decision, words of the following import: “To which decision
the plaintiff (or defendant) excepts.

SEC. 13. The provisions of. this Code, concerning the
prosecution of a civil action, apply to both kinds of proceedings, unless the contrary appears.

SEC. 14. A judgment obtained in an action by proceedings at law, shall not be annulled or modified by any order in an action by equitable proceedings, except for a defence which has arisen or been discovered since the judgment was rendered. But such judgment does not prevent the recovery of any claim, though such claim might have been used as a defense by way of set-off or counter-claim in the action on which judgment was recovered.

obligation of the plaintiff, unless the writing on which the
action or defense is founded is lost, mutilated or destroyed.

SEC. 137. Neither presumptions of law, nor matter or
which judicial notice is taken, need be stated in a pleading.

SEC. 138. If the action. counter—claim, or set-off, is
founded on a note, bond, bill, or other writing, as evidence of
indebtedness, it must be filed as part of the pleading, if in the
power of the party to produce it. If not filed, the reason thereof
must be stated in the pleading. If upon an account, a copy
thereof must, in like manner, be filed with the pleading.

SEC. 139. In construing a pleading for the purpose of
determining its efiects, its allegations shall be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.

SEC. 140. If irrevelent or redundant matter is inserted
in a pleading, it may be stricken out, on motion of any person
aggrieved thereby, at the cost of the party whose pleading
contained it.

SEC. 141. In pleading a judgment, or other determination, of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be
necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction, but such
judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly
given or made. If such allegation is made in a complaint, and
is not controverted in the ‘answer, or made in the answer in
relation to acounter—claim or set-off, and is not controverted in
the reply, it need not be proved on the trial. '

SEC. 142. In pleading the performance of a condition
precedent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the
facts showing such performance, but it may be stated, generally,’
that the party duly performed all the conditions on his part;
and if such allegation is not controverted as stated in the last
SEC. in regard to judgments, it shall not be necessary to
prove it on trial.

SEC. 143. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not
be neccessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts, for

the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff of the
defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose, but

it shall be suiiicient to state generally, that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintiff; and if such allegation is not controverted as stated in Section 141, in regard to
judgments, it shall not be neccessary to prove it on trial.

SEC. 144. In the actions mentioned in the last section,
the defendant may, in his answer, allege both the truth of the
matter charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances legally admissible in evidence, to reduce the amount of
damages, and whether he proves the justification or not, he may
give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.

SEC. 145. In an action for the recovery of real property,
it must be described in the complaint with such convenient

certainty as to enable an officer holding an execution to identify it. ‘

SEC. 146. Every material allegation of the complaint,
not specifically controverted by the answer, and every material
allegation of new matter, in the answer, constituting a counter-claim or set-off, not specifically controverted by the reply,
must, for the purpose of the action,’ be taken as true. But the
allegation of new matter in the answer, not relating to a counter-claim, or set-off, or of new matter in a reply, is to be deemed
controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct denial or
avoidance, as the case may require. Allegations of value, or
of amount of damage, shall not be considered as true, by the
failure to controvert them.

SEC. 147. A material allegation in a pleading, is one
essential to the claim or defense, and which could not be stricken
from the pleading without leaving it insufficient. 4

SEC. 148. If either party shall rely upon any deed or
other writing, he shall tile with his pleading, the original deed,
or writing, if in his power. If he cannot procure such deed,
or writing, he shall so state in his pleading, together with the
reasons therefor, and if such reasons are suflicient, he may file
the best evidence of the contents of such deed, or writing, in
his power. Original deeds and other writin gs, filed by either
party, as above provided, shall remain on file for the inspection of the other party, until allowed by the court to be withdrawn; and in such case, copies attested by the clerk, shall be
substituted by the parties withdrawing the original.

SEC. 149. In actions founded upon a note, bond, bill of
exchange, mortgage, or other written obligation of the defendI

ants, or any of them, the plaintiti may file with his complaint,
the affidavit of himself, or his agent, or attorney, to the effect
that afiiant verily believes that there is no good and valid

defense to said action upon the merits, and that if defense is

made thereto, it will be made for the purpose of delay, merely;
whereupon the court shall not allow an answer to be filed in
said action, or if filed, shall strike out the same, unless it be

accompanied with an affidavit to the effect that the afiiant verily

believes that there is a good and valid defense to said action,
upon the merits thereof. Provided: That such afiidavit shall

not dispense with any verification required in other cases;
provided further: that if such defendant should fail to establish his defense to the merits of said case, the clerk shall tax
against him a docket fee for double the amount allowed by this

Code in other like actions.

SEC. 150. No variance between the allegation in a

pleading and the proof, is to be deemed material, unless it has
actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. Whenever it is
alleged that a party has been so misled, that fact must be
shown to the satisfaction of the court, and it must also be
shown in what respect he has been misled; and thereupon, the

court may order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms.

as may be just. .
SEC. 151. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be

found according to the evidence, and may order an immediate
amendment without costs.

SEC. 152. Where, however, the allegation of the claim
or defense, to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in
some particular, or particulars only, but in its general scope
and meaning, it is not to be deemed a case of variance within
the last two sections, but a failure of proof.

party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a
mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations
material to the case; or when the amendment does not change
substantially the claim or defense, by conforming the pleading
or proceeding to the facts proved. The court may likewise,
in its discretion, allow an answer or reply to be made after the
time limited by this Code, or, by an order, enlarge such time.
And whenever any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform
in any respect, to the provisions of this Code, the court may
permit an amendment of such proceeding, so as to make it
conformable thereto. And when the allegations of a pleading
are so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the

claim or defense is not apparent, the court may require the
pleading to be made detinite and certain by amendment. The
court must, in every stage of an action, disregard any error or
defect in the proceedings which does not affect the substantial
rights of the adverse party; and no judgment shall be reversed
or affected by reason of such error or defect.

SEC. 156. The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may
be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint:
answer or reply, alleging facts material to the case, reocurring
after the filing of the former complaint, answer, or reply.

plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief, or

any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of some act which could produce great or irreparable

injury to the plaintiff, or where during the litigation, it appears
that the defendant is doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or is
procuring or suffering to be done, some act, in violation of the
plaintiff’s rights, respecting the subject of the action and tending to render the judgment ineffectual, a temporary injunctionmay be granted to restrain such act. It may also be granted
in any case where it is specially authorized by statute.

SEC. 295. The injunction may be granted at the commencement of the action, or at any time before judgment, by
the court, or by the judge thereof, or any Judge of the Supreme
Court or Circuit Judge, or by the Probate Judge of the county,
where it appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled
thereto. And, during a litigation, it may be granted by the

Court, or Circuit Judge, where it satisfactorily appears by attidavits that sufiicient grounds exist therefor.

damages and costs that may be occasioned by the injunction.
The court or judge may prescribe the effect of the bond, so as
to secure to the party enjoined the damages to which he may
become entitled, if it is finally decided that the injunction ought
not to have been granted. Where the injunction is to stay
proceedings upon a judgment or final order for money, the
amount for which security is required shall be sutlicient to
cover, with other damages, the sum enjoined, with five years’
interest thereon. When the injunction is to stay proceedings

that may be rendered or made in lieu of it, or so much of it as
exceeds the amount left uninjoined. In other cases, unless otherwise directed by the court or judge, the bbnd shall be to the
effect that the party giving it will pay to the party enjoined
such damages as he may sustain, if it is finally decided that

by the clerk, under the same responsibilities as in other cases
of sureties taken by him.

SEC. 305. The order of injunction shall be addressed to

them by some person appointed by the court for that purpose.

or their counsel. _

behalf of the party in whose favor such judgment was rendered,
his heir, personal representative, or assignee, shall be deemed
to be held in trust for any person holding such lien, to the
amount of his lien until the same is discharged. And when
such judgment is for the recovery of real or personal property,
the lien shall amount to an interest in such property to the
extent of such lien. But such lien in favor of an attorney
for services rendered as aforesaid, shall not prevail against any
one who in good faith and without notice of such lien has made

place convenient thereto, within his discretion, administer an
oath to the jurors, in substance, as follows: “ You and each of

defendant (or defendants) be guilty of the forcibly entry (or
detainer) complained of in the Warrant in this cause. So help
you God.”

SEC. 500. Such justice shall superintend the taking of

by their inquest, say whether the defendants, or either of them
be guilty or not guilty of the forcible entry or detainer complained of, and shall return their inquest, signed by one of their
body, to the justice of the peace. If the jury do not agree,
they may be discharged by the justice presiding, and another
he ordered to be summoned to meet, either immediately or at
some future day, to be then and there fixed and iudorsed on

sentees. Appointment of guardians
' for infants. etc.

SEC. 513. The manner of proving wills and contesting
their probate shall be as follows:

Fz’rst.—Wills shall be proved before, and admitted to record
by the Probate Court of the county of the testator’s residence;
if he had no known place of residence in this State, and land is
devised, then in the county where the land, or the greater part
thereof lies; if no land is devised, then in the county where
he died, or that wherein his estate, or the greater part thereof
shall lie, or where there may be any debt, or demand owing to
him.
Second.—A11 appeal shall lie from the Probate Court to the
Circuit Court, and thence to the Supreme Court, upon every
order admitting a will to record or rejecting it. The Circuit
Court and Supreme Court shall try both law and fact, but the
Supreme Court shall not hear or adjudge any matter of fact
appertaining thereto other than such as may be certified from
the Circuit Court. The appeal to the Circuit Court shall be
taken within three years after rendering the order of probate,
or rejection in the Probate Court, and to the Supreme Court
within one year after final decision in the Circuit Court.

Tlu’rd.—No will shall be received in evidence until it has
been allowed and admitted to record by a Probate Court, and
its probate before such court shall be conclusive, until the same
is superseded, reversed or amended.

Four-tIz.—An y such court, on being informed that a person has
in his custody the will of a testator, may summon him, and by
proper process, compel him to produce the same.

F§;"th.—\Vhen a will of a non-resident of this State, relative
to an estate within this State, has been proved without the same,
an authenticated copy thereof, and the certiiicate of probate
thereof, may be offered for probate in this State. \Vhen such
copy is so offered, the court to which it is offered shall presume,
in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the will was

duly executed and admitted to probate as a will of personalty
in the State or county of the testator’s domicil, and shall admit

such copy to probate as a will of personalty in this State. And
it’ it appears from such copy that the will was proved in the

foreign court of’ probate to have been so executed as to be a
valid will of lands in this State, by the law thereof, such copy
may be admitted to probate as a will of real estate.

Sz'zth.—\Vl1en any will or any such authenticated copy is
offered for probate, and a witness attesting the same, resides
out of this State, or though in the State, is in confinement
in another county or corporation under legal process, or
is unable from sickness, age or other infirmity, to attend
the court before which the same is offered, or resides at
a distance of more than fifty miles, such court may cause a
commission to be issued, anexed to the said will or copy, and
directed to any person authorized by law to take depositions in
other cases, to take his deposition. The deposition of such
witness shall be taken and certified as depositions are taken in
other cases, except that no notice need be given of the time

and place of taking the same, unless it is a case in which the
probate is opposed by some person who has made himself a
party. And the proof’ so given shall have the same effect as if
it had been given in the court, from which the commission
issued.

:5'eventh.—A person offering or intending to offer to a Probate Court a will for probate, may obtain from the clerk of
such court process directed to the proper ofiieer of any county.
requiring him to summon any person interested in such probate,
to appear at the next term of such court, and show cause why
the said will should not be admitted to record.

Eightlz.——The court to which a will is offered for probate, may
cause all persons interested in the probate to be summoned to
appear on a certain day.

NintI:.—Any person interested in such probate may be summoned or proceeded against by order of appearance, and to any
person so interested who is an infant or of unsound mind, a
guardian ad Zitem, may be assigned as in other cases.

Tenth.—When the proceeding is taken to the court, all
necessary parties shall be brought before the court; and upon
the demand of any one of them, a jury shall be empanelled to
try which or how much of any testamentary paper produced is,

or is not the last will of the testator. If no juryjae demanded,
the court shall determine that question, and the final decision
given shall be a bar to any other proceeding to call the probate
or rejection of the will in question—subject to the right of
appeal or writ of error to the.Supreme Court, as hereinbefore
named; but nothing in this section shall preclude a court of
chancery from its jurisdiction to impeach such iinal decision,
for such reason as would give it jurisdiction over any other
judgment at law.

Eleventh.—A Probate Court may, however, without sun1- .

moning any party, proceed to probate and admit the will to
record or reject the same.

Twey'th.—An y person interested, who, at the time of the final
decision in the Circuit Court, resided out of this State, and
was proceeded against by order of appearance only, without
actual appearance or being personally served with process, and
any other person interested who was not a party to the proceed-.
in gs by actual appearance or being personally served with.
process, may, within three years after such iinal decision in theCircuit Court, by a bill in chancery. impeach the decision and
have a retrial of the question of probate; and either partyshall be entitled to a jury for the trial thereof. An infant, not
a party, shall not be barred of such proceedings in chancery
until twelve months after attaining a full age.

Thz’rteenth.—But no such proceeding in chancery for establishing or avoiding a will, shall operate further than is necessary
to the rights of such infant, non-resident, or other party, or
otherwise affect the rights of any other person interested in
the probate.

Fourteenth.—The record of what is proved or deposed in
court by witnesses, on the motion to admit a will to record, and

any depositions lawfully taken out of court on such motion, of '

witnesses who cannot be produced at atrial afterward before a
jury, may, on such trial, he admitted as evidence to have such

weight as the jury shall think they deserve.
Fzjfteenth.—Every will or authenticated copy so admitted to
record by any court, shall be recorded by the clerk thereof and.

remain in his.oiiiee, except during such time as the same may
be carried to another court under subpena duces tecum.

Sz'2:teentIz.—A will may be deposited by the person making
it, or any one for him, with the clerk of the Probate Court of
the county of his residence, for safe keeping, upon payment of_
a fee of one dollar to the clerk who shall receive, keep, and
deliver the same according to the directions on a sealed envelope. If there are no such directions, or the party entitled
does not apply, the will shall be handed to and opened by the
next or some succeeding Probate Court, after the death of the
testator, and there retained for probate.

SEC. 514. The accounts of personal representatives,.

guardians, committees of idiots and lunatics, may be settled in

the manner and by the mode of proeeedin g hereinafter provided::

First.—The Judge of the Probate Court shall make settlements with personal representatives and guardians in his
county. He shall be allowed two dollars and fifty cents for
each settlement. If the same occupies him more than one day,
then two dollars and fifty cents per day, to be paid out of the
estate settled. It‘, in any case, the judge cannot make such
settlement with propriety, then the county clerk of the county
may make the same. If he cannot act with propriety, the judge
may appoint some discreet person, not of kin to either party,
to make the settlement. The judge may, if he thinks proper,
appoint a standing commissioner to make such settlement.

Second.—It shall be the duty of the Probate Judge of each
county, when called upon by a personal representative or guardian, or committee, or any person interested, to state and settle
the accounts of such fiduciary. He shall have power to hear
testimony on such settlement in support or opposition to any
item. He must reduce to writing all verbal evidence adduced
before him. He is in all cases to be governed by law and justice, and shall give no credit to a tiduciary for disbursements
or for services without evidence to justify the same. His
report, in writing, he shall return to the county clerk of the
county. His report shall show the result, giving items of debit
and credit, and he shall return therewith, all vouchers and evidence adduced before him on the settlement. The clerk shall
indorse on the report the time of filing the same, and it shall
lay over one term for exceptions, to be filed by any person
interested. If no exceptions are filed by the second term of
the court, the report shall, if approved, be recorded. If exceptions are taken, other evidence besides that reported may be
heard, and the court shall, upon the whole case, alter or amend
the report and order it to be recorded, or so order it without
altering or amending, as shall appear right and legal. The
vouchers accompanying the report shall not be recorded, but
must be carefully kept on file in the clerk's otiice. Any new
evidence given in court must be reduced to writing and filed with
report. Settlement so made and recorded shall be prima facie

evidence between the parties interested. Notice of the time

and place of such settlement must be given to all parties interested, if resident in the county. Any fiduciary failing to settle
when so notiiied, without good excuse, shall, on notice thereof,
be fined by the County Court twenty dollars. Witness may
be summoned at the instance of either party, to give evidence
before the judge on the settlement, or on the trial of exceptions
by the court, and their attendance may be coerced by attachment and fine. In making settlements the judge may adjourn
from day to day, as long as the business requires it. He may
interrogate personal representatives and guardians, on oath,
touching any matter drawn in question in making a settlement,
and their statements, when so interrogated, must be reduced to

writing and returned with the report. No evidence shall be

presumed to have been given on a settlement except such as is
reported.

SEC. 515. The accounts of trustees may be settled in
the same manner, and the settlement shall have the same effect
as prescribed in regard to the settlements of the iiduciaries
named in the last Section. The Probate Court of the county
in which the deed or will creating the trusts is recorded,‘ shall
have the jurisdiction of making the settlements.

1

SEC. 649. The party who begins the case must ordinarily exhaust his evidence before the other begins. But the
order of proof shall be regulated by the court, so as to expedite
the trial and enable the tribunal to obtain a clear view of the
whole evidence.

SEC. 650. The court shall exercise a reasonable control

‘ over the mode of interrogation, so as to make it rapid, distinct,

as little annoying to the witness, and as effective for the extraction of the truth as may be; but, subject to this control, the
parties may put such legal and pertinent questions as they may
see fit. The court, however, may stop the production of further
evidence on a particular point, when the evidence upon it is
already so full as to preclude reasonable doubt. ’

SEC. 651. The examination of a witness by the party
producing him is the direct examination; the examination of
the samewitness upon the same matter, byithe adverse party,
is the cross-examination. The direct examination must becompleted before the cross-examination begins, unless the court
otherwise directs.

SEC. 652. A question that suggests to the witness the
answer which the examining party desires, is a leading question. On the direct examination, leading questions are not
allowed, except under special circumstances, making it appear
that the interests of justice require it. On cross-examination,
the adverse party may put leading questions ; but if he examines the witness on new matters, such examination is subject
to the same rules as the direct examination.

SEC. 653. The party producing a witness, is not allowed
to impeach his credit, by evidence of bad character, unless it is
in a case in which it was indispensiblc that the party should
produce him ; but he may contradict him by other evidence,

and by showing that he has made statements different from his
present testimony. '

SEC. 654. A witness may be impeached by the party
against whom he is produced, by contradictory evidence, by
showing that he has made statements different from his present
testimony, or by evidence that his general reputation for truth,
or immorality, renders him unworthy of belief, but not by evidence of particular wrongful acts, except that it may be shown,
by the examination of a witness, or record of a judgment, that
he has been convicted of felony.

SEC. 655. Before other evidence can be offered of the
Witness having made at another time a different statement, he
must be inquired of concerning the same, with the circum-'
stances of time, and persons present, as correctly as the examining party can present them ; and if it is in writing, it must
be shown to the witness, and he allowed to explain it.

SEC. 656. Evidence of the good character of a witness is
inadmissible until his general reputation has been impeached.

SEC. 657. A witness once examined, can not be reexamined as to the same matter, without leave of the court.
But he may be re-examined as to any new matter upon which
he has been examined by the adverse party. After the examination on both sides is concluded, the witness can not be recalled without leave of the court. _

SEC. 658. If either party requires it, the judge may exelude from the court room any witness of the adverse party,
not at the time under examination, so that he may not hear
the testimony of the other witness. °

SEC. 659. A person present before a court or judicial
otlicer, may be compelled to testify in the same manner as if
he was served with a subpena.

SEC. 660. The judge or juror may be called as a witness
by either party, but in such cases, it is in the discretion of the
court to suspend the trial and order it to take place before
another judge or jury; and where a party knows, at the time
the jury are impaneled, that a juror is to be called by him as
a witness, he shall then disclose it, and the juror shall be excluded from the jury.

SEC. 661. VVhenever a writing is shown to a witness, it
may be inspected by the adverse party, and, if proved by the
witness and allowed by the court, it must he read to the jury
before his testimony is closed; otherwise, it can not he read
unless the witness is recalled.

per cent. per annum thereon from the date of such sale, and
all charges thereon for the use of the purchaser, and shall offer
to credit his execution with a sum at least equal to ten per cent.
of the amount for which said land sold, which offer shall be
regarded as his bid. All of which shall be indorsed upon said

creditor, it shall bar such redemption ; and the right of redempion of such judgment creditor, as against the purchaser, or any

the judgment creditor, the oflicer shall pay the same to such

judgment creditor to the oflicer. The right of redemption
shall be in the order of priority of judgment, but if any judgment creditor shall, for thirty days after a sale or redemption
upon a judgmentprior to his, fail to pay off prior bids, and
bid for the redemption of such property, as provided in this chapter, he shall be deemed to have waived his priority, as
against others who have complied with the provisions of this chapter. /'

SEC. 697. After the time for redemption has-expired,
the sheriff, or his successor, shall convey by deed the property
sold under the provisions of this title, to the person entitled
