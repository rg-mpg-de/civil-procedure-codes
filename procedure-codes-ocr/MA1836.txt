such suit, such otiicer of the company shall give such certificate to
the ofiicer holding the writ ; and if he shall unreasonabl refuse to do
so, or if he shall wilfully give a false certificate thereo , he shall be

specially provided.

SEC. 45. If the defendant is out of the state, at the time of the
service of the summons, the service thereof shall be made by leaving
it, if it is a separate summons, at his last and usual place of abode,
if there be any within the state, and, if it is an original summons, a

judgment or execution in the other.

SE01‘. 50. If there are several defendants in the original action, each of them shall be authorized to bring such cross action against!
the original plaintiff, and upon recovering judgment therein, he may i

the latter judgment had been against himself alone.

SEC. 51. The writ, in such cross action, maybe served on the ‘
person who appears as the attorney of the plaintiff in the original suit, ‘

pending, may order continuances thereof, as they shall think neces— '
sary or proper, to enable the absent party to defend the action brought

execution against that which shall be recovered against him; provided, that the suits shall not be unreasonably delayed, by the neglect
or default of either party.

left, the court may, in their discretion, order a new summons or notice to be issued and served, in such manner as they shall direct;
and the service, so made and returned, shall be as effectual as if duly
made and returned on the original writ.

upon the same writ, by one or more oflicers, and in one or more

verbal directions to the officer, require him to serve the writ, either
by an attachment of goods or estate, or by arresting the defendant,
and the oilicer shall serve the writ, according to such directions, if
it is in his power to do so.

SEC. 57. When any personal property is attached, whether on
one or more writs, and the debtor and all the attaching creditors shall

of any goods or chattels, which are liable to perish, or waste, or to
be greatly reduced in value by keeping, or which cannot be kept

examined and appraised, and shall be afterwards sold, or otherwise
disposed of, in the manner following.

value of such goods, to be appointed and sworn before a magistrate,
to the faithful discharge of their duty, as appraisers in the case.
SEC. 60. The appraisers shall be appointed, one by the credit' or or creditors, in the several suits, one by the debtor or debtors,

nomination, the oflicer shall appoint one in their behalf.

SEC. 61. The appraisers shall examine the attached property,
and if they shall be of opinion, that the same or any part thereof is
liable to perish or waste, or to be greatly reduced in value by keeping, or that it cannot be kept, without great and disproportionate expense, they shall proceed to appraise the same, according to their best
skill and judgment, at the value thereof in money, and the goods
shall thereupon be sold by the oflicer, and the proceeds thereof shall
be held and disposed of, in the manner before provided, in the case

such judgments as shall be recovered in the suits, in which the goods
were attached, if demanded within the time, during which the goods
would have been held by the respective attachments, or within thirty
days after the time, when the creditors respectively would have been
entitled to demand payment out of the proceeds of the said goods, if
they had been sold as before provided.

SEC. 63. The officer, taking such bond, shall return the same
with the writ, on which the first attachment is made, in like manner
as bail bonds are returned, with a certificate of his doings in relation
thereto, and in case of a forfeiture of the bond, the creditors, or any
one or more of them, may bring an action of debt thereon, in the
name of the oflicer.

S1:c'r. 64. The writ in such action on the bond shall, in addition
to the usual indorsement, have also indorsed on it the names of all the
creditors, by whom the action is brought; and in case judgment is
rendered for the defendants, executions for the costs shall be issued
against all the creditors, whose names are so indorsed.

SEC. 6 . If judgment is rendered for the plaintiff, the money

the reasonable expenses, incurred by the creditors in prosecuting the
suit, so far as the same shall not be reimbursed by the costs recovered of the defendant, and the residue shall belong to all the attaching
creditors, according to their respective rights.

Sncr. 66. The court may, upon a hearing in chancery, deter- .
mine the rights of the several attaching creditors, and may thereupon 1
award a separate execution, for the amount due or payable to each,
to be served and levied to his own use, in like manner as is provided
in the case of a judgment rendered on a bond given by an administrator to the judge of probate ; or they may award one execution, for
the whole sum due on the bond, and may cause the money received
thereon to be paid and distributed to and among the creditors, according to their respective rights.

Sr-:c'r. 67. No judgment or execution shall be awarded, for the 1
use of any creditor, without reserving as much as may be due upon I
any prior attachment, whether the creditor in such prior suit be or be 1
not one of those, by whom the action is brought on the bond.

SI-JCT. 68. Any creditor, entitled to the benefit of the bond, who 4
shall not have joined in bringing the action thereon, may, after ai
judgment in such action, bring a writ of scire facias on the judgment, j
and recover any sum, that may be due to him upon the bond, or he
may, upon his own motion, at any time before nal judgment in the
action on the bond, be allowed, upon such terms as the court shall
prescribe, to become a party to the action, in like manner and with
the same effect, as if he had been one of those by whom it was
originally brought.

S1-:c'r. 69. No creditor, whose cause of action on such bond ac- 1
crucd more than one year before the commencement of the action ,'
thereon, shall have judgment or execution in such action, and no:
creditor shall sue out any such writ of scire facias on the judgment, '
unless within one year after his cause of action shall accrue.

ceive satisaiction of his judgment, notwithstanding any prior attach- '
ment, provided he is otherwise entitled to demand the money, and
provided also, that a suflicient sum be left, of the proceeds of the
goods, or of the appraised value thereof, to satisfy all prior attachments.

SI-JCT. 71. When any goods are sold or disposed of, either by 3
consent of the parties, or after an appraisal as before provided, the 1
proceeds thereof, whilst remaining in the hands of the otlicer, shall be %
liable to be further attached b him, as the property of the original
defendant, in like manner as t e goods themselves would have been
liable, if they had remained in the possession of the officer, and the
proceeds so attached shall be held and disposed of, in the same manner, as if the attachment had been made on the goods themselves,
before the sale thereof.

SEC. 72. Nothing contained in the preceding section shall prevent the officer from paying over to the defendant the surplus of the

appoint one of the appraisers, and the debtor shall not appoint any.

SEC. 74. The property so appraised shall be delivered to the
part owner, at whose request it was appraised, upon his giving bond
to the attaching otlicer, in a sufficient penalty, and with two sufiicient
sureties, with condition to restore the same, in like good order, or to

pay to the officer the appraised value of the defendant’s share or interest in such property, or to satisfy all such judgments as shall be
recovered in the suit in which the property is attached, if demanded
within the time during which the property would have been held by
the respective attachments.

SEC. 75. If such appraised value or any part thereof shall be
so paid, the said defendant’s share of the property shall thereby become pledged to the party to whom it was delivered, and he may sell
the same, if not redeemed, and shall account to the defendant for the
balance, if any, of the proceeds of such sale.

SI-:o'r. 76. If the attachment shall be in any way dissolved, the
party, to whom the defendant’s share was delivered, shall restore the
same to the defendant, or to the officer, who made the attachment, to
be by him delivered to the defendant.

SEC. 77. The doings of the officer, together with the said bond,
shall be returned by him, in the same manner, that is before provided,
in the case of a bond given by a debtor, upon the delivery to him of
any property that is attached ; and, in case of the forfeiture of any
such bond, given by a part owner, the like proceedings may be had
thereon, as are before provided upon the forfeiture of the said bond
given by a debtor.

Snow. 78. Any personal property of a debtor, that is subject to
any mortgage, pledge or lien, and of which the debtor has the right ot
redemption, may be attached and held, in like manner as if it were
unincumbered, provided the attaching creditor shall pay or tender
to the mortgagee, pawnee or holder of the property, the amount for
which it is so liable, within twenty four hours after the same is demanded.

Sr-:c'r. 79. Every such mortgagee, pawnee or holder shall, when
demanding payment of the money due to him, state, in writing, a just
and true account of the debt or demand for which the property is liable
to him, and deliver it to the attaching creditor or ofiicer; and if the
same is not paid or tendered to him, within twenty four hours thereafter, the attachment shall be dissolved, and the property shall be restored to him, and the attaching creditor shall moreover be liable to
the mortgagee, pawnee, or holder of the property, for any damages,
that he may have sustained by the attachment thereof.

with lawful interest therefor.

Sr-;c'r. 82. If the plaintiff, after having redeemed the goods soc
attached, shall not recover 'udgment in the suit, he shall nevertheless I
be entitled to hold the goods, until the defendant shall repay to him
the sum, that he shall have aid for the redemption, or as much thereof, as the defendant would ave been obliged to pay to the mortgagee, pawnee, or holder of the goods, if they had not been attached,
with interest, from the time when the satne shall he demanded of the
defendant.

SE01‘. 83. When any person shall claim any title or interest, by 1
force of a subsequent attachment, or purchase, or mortgage, or in any ;
other manner, in any estate, real or personal, that is attached in a suit
between other persons, such claimant may be allowed to dispute the
validity and effect of the prior attachment, on the ground that the
sum demanded in the first suit was not justly due, or that it was not
payable, when the action was commenced.

Sscr. 84. The person objecting to the attachment may file his i
petition in the court, in which the first suit is pending, at any time be-

petition is founded, and also the grounds of his own claim.

SEc'r. 85. The petitioner, or some person in his behalf, shall‘
make oath that his claim is just and legal, and also that all the other ,
facts set forth in the petition are true, or are believed by the deponent
to be so.

SE01‘. 86. The court, upon the hearing of the petition, shall, at
the motion of either party, direct a trial, by jury, of any question of
fact, arising in the inquiry, and if it shall appear to the court that the
sum demanded in the rior suit, or any part of it, is not justly due,
or was not payable, w en the action was commenced, they shall order
the attachment therein made to be dissolved, in whole or in part, as
justice and equity shall require, but the order so made shall have no
other effect on the prior suit.

Saar. 87. The court, upon such inquiry, may examine on oath
the plaintiff, who made the prior attachment, and his declarations
upon such examination shall be admitted as evidence in the case, provided there is no other objection to his competency, but that of his
interest as a party in the suit.

SEC. 88. The proceedings, between the two adverse claimants
or plaintiffs, shall not be affected by any plea, or other act of the defendant in the prior suit, nor by the judgment, if any, that shall be
rendered therein ; but the defendant may be admitted and examined
as a witness, in the proceedings between the said other parties.

SEC. 89. No attachment shall be dissolved, in manner aforesaid,
by reason of any defence to the action, founded on the laws for the
limitation of actions, or for restraining excessive usury, or for requiring certain contracts to be made in writing, or of any other like defence, provided, it shall appear to the court that the demand is otherwise well founded, and is justly and equitably due.

SE01‘. 90. The court may, upon every such inquiry, award to
either party such costs, as they shall think just and reasonable; and
if the prior attachment is maintained, they may award to the attaching
creditor such damages, as they shall judge reasonable, and execution
may be issued, in the common form, for all such costs and damages.

SEC. 91. The court shall also, upon the filing of the petition,
require a bond or recognizance of the petitioner, or of some person
in his behalf, with suflicient surety or sureties, with condition to pay
to the adverse party all such damages and costs as shall be awarded
to him, in the proceedings upon such petition.

SEC. 92. If, during the pendency of the proceedings upon such

petition, the action, in which the attachment is made, should be carried to a higher court, the inquiry concerning the attachment shall
be carried to the same court, and shall be there heard and determined, in like manner as if the action had been originally commenced
there.
' SE01‘. 93. The decision or judgment of the court, upon such an
inquiry, whether the attachment be thereby vacated, or held to be
valid and effectual, shall be a bar to any action, to be brought by the
petitioner, against the party who made the attachment, for any supposed fraud or deceit therein. '

nor to any action whatever, that shall be commenced before this act

in the hands of his executors or administrators.

SEC. 96. When any goods or chattels, attached by an oiiicer,
shall be claimed or taken away by any other person, and an action of
replevin, of trover, or of trespass therefor, shall be brought by or
against the officer, the action shall not be abated by the death of either
party, but may be prosecuted by or against the executor or administrator of the deceased party, in the manner provided in the ninety
third chapter.

SEC. 97. If judgment in any such case shall be recovered by
the executor or administrator of the ofiicer, the goods or money recovered shall be held, appropriated, and disposed of, in the same
manner, as they would and ought to have been by the officer, if he
had lived and recovered the same himself.

SI-:c'r. 98. If the judgment shall be rendered against the executor
or administrator of the ofiicer, the goods and the damages recovered
shall be returned, delivered, and paid in full, by the executor or administrator, if he has sufficient therefor, although the estate of the
deceased should be insolvent.

SEC. 99. All goods, taken by replevin from an ofiicer, who has
attached them, shall be considered as still remaining in his custody
and control, so far as to be liable to further successive attachments,
in lil_te manner as if the goods themselves had remained in his posSBSSIOD.

SEC. 100. In case of a judgment for a return of the goods so
replevied, the plaintiff in the re levin and his sureties shall be liable
for the whole of the goods, or t e value thereof, although the attachment, for which they are eventually held, should have been made
after the taking of the goods by the replevin.

SE01‘. 101. If an oliicer, after making an attachment of goods,
shall die or be removed from otlice, whilst the attachment remains in
force, the same goods, whether replevied or remaining in possession
of the otlicer, or of his executors or administrators, may be further
attached .by any other oflicer, so as to bind the goods, or the proceeds thereof, in like manner as if the latter attachment had been
made by the first mentioned officer.

SEC. 102. The otiicer, making the latter attachment in such
case, shall not take the goods themselves, but the attachment shall
be made by a return, setting forth an attachment in the common form,
and stating by whom the goods were previously attached, and if the
goods have not been replevied, by leaving a certified copy of the writ,
and of the return of that attachment, with the former otlicer, if living,
or if he is dead, with his executor or administrator, or whoever else
shall then have possession of the goods; or if the goods shall have
been replevied, and the officer who made the original attachment is
dead, such copy shall be left with the plaintiff in replevin, or his executors or administrators, and the attachment shall be considered as made,
when such copy is delivered, in either of the modes before provided.

SEC. 103. In the copy of the writ, required to be so left, it
shall not be necessary to insert the declaration.

SE01‘. 104. Goods, that have been taken by replevin from an attaching otlicer, shall not be further attached, as the property of the
original defendant, in any other manner than that provided in the five
preceding sections, so long as they are held by the person, who replevied them, or by any one holding under him, unless the original
defendant shall have acquired a new title to the goods.

SEC. 105. When any real estate, goods, chattels, or effects,
are attached, and the debtor dies before they are taken or seized on
execution, the attachment shall be dissolved, provided administration
of the estate of the deceased shall be granted in this state, within one
year after his decease, or that application for such administration
shall be made within the said year, and that administration shall be
afterwards granted, upon such application ; and if no such administration be granted, the property attached shall continue bound by the
attachment, in like manner as if the debtor were still living.

SEC. 106. When the attachment is of goods, the officer shall,
upon demand, deliver them to the executor or administrator, if any
shall be appointed in this state, within the time limited in the preceding section, and upon receiving from the executor or administrator his
legal fees and charges for attaching and keeping the goods.

St-:c'r. 107. If the oflicer shall have sold the goods on execution,
before such demand, or if he shall have sold, in like manner, any

other chattel interest, or any right of redeeming real estate, attached ‘

as aforesaid, he shall not be considered a trespasser for so doing, but
he shall be liable only for the proceeds of the sale, after deducting his
legal fees and charges for attaching, keeping and selling the goods °

and such proceeds may be recovered by the executor or administrator, in an action for money had and received.
St-:c'r. 108. If the otiicer in such case shall have paid over the

I proceeds of the sale to the judgment creditor, before such demand,

he shall be exempted from all further liability therefor, and the executor or administrator, if appointed as before provided, may recover
from the judgment creditor the amount so paid to‘ him, in an action
for money had and received.

Saar. 109. The defendant, in an action founded on either of
the three preceding sections, shall not be allowed, in any manner, to
set off any demand, that he may have against the executor or administrator, or against the estate of the deceased.
S1-:c'r. 110. The otiicer, who serves an original writ, shall never

, be liable, for not having arrested the defendant, unless he has been
expressly required to make the arrest by the plaintiff or his attorney.

St-:c'r. 111. No person shall be arrested or held to bail, for any
debt or demand, arising on any contract, made after the fourth day of
July in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty four, unless
the plaintiff, or some person in his behalf, shall make oath before
some justice of the peace, that the plaintiff has a demand against the
defendant, upon the cause of action stated in the writ, which the deponent believes to be justly due, and upon which he expects that the
plaintiff will recover ten dollars or upwards, and that the deponent

‘ has reasonable cause to believe that the defendant is about to depart

beyond the jurisdiction of the court, to which the writ is returnable,
and not to return until after judgment may probably be recovered in
said suit, so that he cannot be arrested on the first execution, if any,
which may issue in such suit.

SEC. 112. When any person, who is arrested in a civil action,
is committed to prison, for want of bail, he shall be held in prison,
unless he is bailed, or otherwise discharged by order of law, until final
judgment in the suit, in which he was arrested ; and if the final judgment shall be against him, he shall be held for thirty days thereafter,
in order that his body may be taken in execution.

SEC. 113. If any person, so committed, shall claim support as
a pauper, the jailer shall furnish his support, at the rate of one dollar
and twenty five cents a week, to be paid by the creditor, so long as
the debtor is kept in close confinement in that suit.

SEC. 114. The jailer in such a case shall not be required to detain such person in prison, unless the creditor, at whose suit he is
committed, shall advance the money necessary for his support, or give
satisfactory security therefor, in the manner provided in the ninety
seventh chapter, respecting persons committed on execution.

SEC. 115. If the person so committed shall have been surrendered by his hail, the bail shall be liable for his support, in like manner and to the same extent, as is provided in the ninety seventh cha

SECION 1. When bail is taken in any civil action, it shall be
taken, as heretofore practised in this Commonwealth, by a bond to
the sheriff, if the writ is served by him or his deputy, otherwise to
the coroner, or other officer, by whom the writ is served, with condition that the defendant shall appear and answer to the plaintiff in
the suit, and that he shall abide the final judgment of the court thereon, and shall not avoid.

Snow. 2. No ofiicer shall be required to accept a bail bond, un- t
less it be with two sureties at the least, having sufficient within the i

county in which the principal is arrested, or held in custody ; and if
he take a bail bond with only one surety, he shall be liable to the
plaintiff for any loss sustained by the insutiiciency of the bail, although the surety may have been actually suflicient when taken.

SEC. 3. A bail bond shall bind the persons who execute it,
though it be taken with one surety only, or with two or more sureties, when they or either of them may not have suflicient within the
county, as is required in the preceding section.

SE01‘. 4. The bail bond shall be retumed and filed with the writ,
and the clerk shall note on the writ, that a bond is so filed ; and in
case of an appeal, the bond shall be sent, with the other papers, to
the court appealed to.

SEC. 5. In case of the avoidance of the principal, and the return on the execution, that he is not found, his bail shall be obliged
to satisfy the judgment, with interest thereon, from the time when it
was rendered, unless he shall discharge himself, by surrendering the
principal, before final judgment against him on the writ of scire
facias, or by other sutiicient defence in that suit.

SEC. 6. The bail bond shall be considered as so far a matter of
record, and of the nature of a recognizance, that the creditor may
take out a writ of scire facias thereon, in his own name, against the
bail, in which it shall be sutlicient to allege, substantially, that the
defendants became bail, without setting forth the bail bond.

Snow. 7. The scire facias shall he issued from the court in
which the judgment against the principal is rendered, and may be
taken out of the clerk’s office in vacation, as well asin term time.

SEC. 8. No such action shall be maintained against any person
as bail, unless the writ of scire facias he served on him, within one
year after the rendition of final judgment against the principal.

SEC. 9. The defendants in such action may either jointly or severally plead, that they never became bail, as alleged in the writ, and shall
thereupon be entitled to every ground of defence, of which they
could have availed themselves, upon a plea that the bond is not their
deed, if an action of debt had been brought on the bond; or they
may plead specially any sufficient matter in their discharge.

Sncr. 10. The bail may surrender the principal in the court
where the suit is pending on the scire facias, at any time before final
judgment therein against them, and on paying the costs of suit on the
scire facias up to that time, they shall be discharged.

Sncr. 11. The principal so surrendered shall he committed to
the common jail, there to remain thirty days, in order to his being
taken in execution.

a writ of scire facias, exonerate himself from all further responsibility,
by surrendering his principal, in the manner provided in the five following sections.

SEC. 13. Such surrender may be made to the keeper of the
county jail, either in the county in which the principal was arrested,
or in that to which the original writ against the principal was returnahle, and the jailer shall receive the prisoner and hold him in custody,
in like manner as if he had been committed by the ollicer, who arrested him on the original writ.

Sr-:c'r. 14. The 'ailer shall not be obliged to receive any erson so
surrendered, unless the bail shall deliver to him a copy o the bail
bond, attested by the oflicer who took it, or by the clerk in whose
custody it may be ; and the delivery of such copy shall be a sutiicient
warrant for the jailer, although the surrender and commitment should
prove to be unlawful, on the part of the bail.

SEC. 15. The bail shall, within fourteen days after such surrender, deliver to the jailer a copy of the original writ, or process,
whereby the prisoner was arrested, with a co y of the return indorsed
thereon, attested by the otiicer who served tlie writ, or by the clerk
into whose otiice it is returned.

S1-:c'r. 16. He shall also, within the same fourteen days, give
notice in writing to the plaintiff in the suit, or to his attorney, of the
time when, and the place where, the prisoner was so committed.

SEC. 17. If the surrender is made, after a writ of scire facias is
taken out against the bail, he shall, within fourteen days after the surrender, pay the costs of suit on the scire facias ; the same to be paid to
the creditor, or his attorney or to be left for his use with the jailer ;
provided however, that if the writ of scire facias has not been served
on the bail, he shall not be required to pay the costs thereof, until
twenty four hours after he has notice of the issuing of the writ, and
after a demand of the costs made on him by the creditor.

SEC. 18. Every person, who is surrendered by his bail and
committed to prison, shall be received by the jailer, and held in custody, and may be forthwith bailed, whether notice of the surrender
shall or shall not have been given to the plaintiff; and shall in all respects have the same rights and privileges as if he had been committed
upon the original arrest.

SEC. 19. Nothing contained in the preceding sections shall impair the right of bail, in all cases, to surrender their principal in the
court in which the original suit 'is pending, at any time before final
judgment therein ; or, after judgment, to surrender him to the oflicer,
who may hold the execution thereon, at any time before the return of
the execution.

SEC. 20. When bail is taken in any action before a justice of
the peace, the justice may issue a scire facias against the bail, although
the amount of the debt and costs on the original judgment exceed
the amount, to which his jurisdiction is otherwise limited; and the
rights and obligations of the bail, and all the proceedings, as to the
surrender of the principal and the action against the bail, shall be substantially the same, as are provided with regard to bail, when taken in
suits in other courts.

SEC. 21. When the bail, in any suit before a justice, proposes
to surrender his principal in court, either during the pendency of the
original suit, or of the suit on the scire facias, the bail shall procure
the attendance of some otiicer, qualified to serve legal process in the
case, to whom the principal may be committed.

SEC. 22. Every such officer, who is seasonably notified, and
requested to attend at a justice’s court, for the purpose aforesaid,
shall be bound to attend, and to receive and take charge of the principal, if committed to his custody by the justice.

SEC. 23. When the principal is surrendered in a justice’s

court, an entry thereof shall be made on the record, and he shall be
forthwith committed to the omcer in attendance, to be conveyed to
the common jail of the county, or otherwise disposed of according
to law.

S1-:c'r. 24. If the surrender is made in a justice’s court, after
final judgment in the original suit, the bail shall deliver to the odicer
a copy of the entry of the surrender, attested by the justice, and the
otiicer shall deliver the same copy to the’ jailer, on committing the
prisoner to his custody ; and this shall be a sutiicient warrant to the
oflicer, for receiving the prisoner and conveying him to the jail, and
to the jailer for holding him in custody, according to law.

SEc'r. 25. If the principal is so surrended and committed, before
dnal judgment in the original suit, the bail shall deliver to the ofiicer
a copy of the original writ, with the return indorsed thereon, attested
by the justice, and the officer shall deliver the same copy to the jailer,
on committing the prisoner to his custody ; and this shall be a sumcient warrant to the otiicer and to the jailer, for receiving, commit- E

ting and holding the prisoner, according to law.
SE01‘. 26. The officer shall be allowed the same fees, as are
provided for arresting and committing a defendant on mesne process,

7. “ how taken and disposed of.  16. Exception.

Sacrron 1. When any defendant, being duly served with process, shall fail to appear, his default shall be recorded, and the charge
in the declaration shall be taken to be true, and judgment shall be
rendered accordingly.

SEc'r. 2. If, after such default at the first term, the defendant
shall appear before the jury is dismissed, the court may take off the
default, and allow the appearance to be entered, upon the defendant’s

paying the plaintiff ’s costs up to that time, or such part thereof as the
court shall think reasonable.

SEC. 3. If the defendant is not an inhabitant or resident within 1
the state, or if his residence is not known to the plaintiff, nor to the 1
otlicer serving the writ in the case, or if the defendant has no last and 1

usual place of abode, nor any tenant, agent or attorney within the
state, known to the said plaintiff or officer, the court, upon suggestion
thereof being made, and upon the facts appearing by the otIicer’s return on the writ, shall order the action to be continued from term to 1
term, until notice of the suit shall be given in such manner as the court ‘
may order ; and if after such notice, the defendant shall not appear '
at the term to which the action may be continued, judgment may be
rendered against him upon default.

SE01‘. 4. When judgment is so rendered upon the default of an _
absent defendant, he shall be entitled to a review of the action as of ,
right, provided the writ of review be sued out within one year after
the judgment, and be commenced and prosecuted in the manner provided in the ninety ninth chapter.

St~:c'r. 5. If such review is not so prosecuted as of right, the de- l
fendant may, at any time within one year after he shall first have notice of the judgment, apply by petition to the supreme judicial court,
for a review of the action, and if it shall appear to the court that justice requires a revision of the case, they may grant a review thereof,
on such terms as they shall think reasonable.

SEC. 6. When judgment in any personal action is rendered, as
above provided, upon the default of an absent defendant, the plaintiff
shall not take out execution thereon within one year thereafter, unless
he shall first give bond to the defendant, with one or more suiiicient
sureties, in a sum equal to double the amount recovered, with condition to repay the amount so recovered, if the judgment shall be reversed upon a review to he brought, by the original defendant, at any
time within one year after the original judgment, or as much of the
amount first recovered as shall be recovered back upon such review.

SEc'r. 7. The said bond shall be deposited with the clerk of the
court for the use of the defendant, and the clerk shall decide on the
sutiiciency of the sureties, saving a right of appeal from his decision
to any justice of the court in which the judgment is rendered.

SEc'r. 8. If the execution in any such personal action shall be
levied on real estate, no alienation thereof by the original plaintiff shall
prevent the defendant from retaking the same, or as much thereof as
may be necessary to satisfy the judgment, if any, that he shall recover on such review, provided the writ of review be sued out within
one year after the original judgment.

Sncr. 9. If the original judgment be for seizin of any premises
demanded in a real action, the demandant may take out his writ of
seizin without giving bond ; and if the judgment be reversed in whole
or in part upon a review, whether sued out within the year or afterwards, the original tenant may have restitution of the premises, in like
manner as upon a reversal on a writ of error.

S1:-:c'r. 10. In personal actions founded on tort, against several
defendants, if any one of them is out of the state at the time of the
service of the writ, the suit shall be conducted, with regard to the

absent defendant, in every thing relating to the service of the writ,
the judgment, the review thereof, and the execution, in like manner
as if he had been the only defendant in the case.

SEC. 11. If an action founded on contract is brought against
several defendants, of whom any one is within the state, and any other is absent, and the plaintiff recovers judgment, he shall take it without any of the conditions and regulations above provided, as to a review of the judgment, and as to giving bond, and alienating any real
estate taken in execution ; but he shall not take judgment against any
such absent defendant, unless under such circumstances as would
have entitled him to judgment against the absent party, if he had been
the only defendant in the case.

SEC. 12. If an action founded on contract is brought against

several defendants, and the writ is duly served on one or more of
them, but no legal service is made on the others, either by attachment of property or otherwise, by reason of their absence from the
state, or for other suflicient cause, the action may nevertheless proceed against those who are duly served with process, without any
further proceedings against the others.

SEC. 13. If judgment shall be rendered against one or more of
several joint contractors, in the manner provided in the preceding
SECion, and shall remain unsatisfied, an action on the same contract
may be afterwards maintained against any of the other joint contractors, in like manner as if the contract had been joint and several.

. St-:c'r. 14. In real actions against several tenants, if any one of
them is out of the state the suit shall be conducted with regard to
him, in like manner as if he had been the only person sued.

SEC. 15. In mixed actions, if the defendant, or if any one of
two or more joint defendants, is out of the state, the suit shall be conducted, with regard to the absent defendant, in every thing relating to
the judgment, the review thereof, and the bond upon issuing execution, in the manner before provided with respect to personal actions,
when founded on tort; and in every thing relating to the service of
the writ and the notice of the suit to be given to the defendant, it
shall be considered and conducted as a real action.

SE01‘. 16. None of the rules before prescribed, concerning actions brought against a person who is out of the state, shall apply to
a cross action brought, as provided in the ntnetieth chapter, by the
defendant in a prior suit, against the plaintiff in the same suit.

survivor, and the executor or administrator of the deceased party, in
the manner provided in this chapter.

SI‘-JCT. 2. The action or the a peal may be entered, in such cases,
if it is not already entered, and e death of the party shall be suggested on the record, and his executor or administrator may, at the
same term, or within such further time as the court shall allow, appear
and take upon himself the prosecution or defence of the suit, as the
case may be; and it shall be thenceforth conducted in the same manner, as if it had been originally commenced by or against the same
executor or administrator.

Sacr. 3. If the executor or administrator does not voluntarily.

appear, the surviving party may take out a citation from the court or
the justice of the peace, before whom the cause is pending, requiring
the executor or administrator to appear, and take upon himself the
prosecution or defence of the suit.

SEC. 4. The citation, if taken out of court in term time, may
be made returnable at the same, or the next succeeding term, as the
court shall order, and if taken out in vacation, it shall be returnable
at the next term ; and if issued by a justice of the peace, it shall be
made returnable at such time as he shall direct, and in all cases, it
shall be served fourteen days at least before the return day.

Snow. 5. If the executor or administrator shall not appear on the ‘
return of the citation, or within such further time as the court or jus- t

tice shall allow, he shall be nonsuited or defaulted, and judgment
shall be rendered against him, in like manner as if the action had
been originally commenced by or against him, in his said capacity,
except as provided in the following section.

SEC. 6. When an executor shall be nonsuited or defaulted,
without having taken upon himself the prosecution or defence of the
suit, he shall not be personally liable for any costs in the action ; but

the estate of the deceased in his hands shall be liable for the costs, as
well as for the debt or damages, if any are recovered.

SEC. 7. In addition to the actions, which survive by the common
law, the following shall also survive, that is to say ; actions of replevin
and trover, actions of trespass for assault, battery, or imprisonment,
or for goods taken and carried away, and actions of trespass and trespass on the case for damage done to real or personal estate.

SEC. 8. All the said last mentioned actions may be originally

time, they may be prosecuted or defended by or against his executor
or administrator.

SE01‘. 9. When an action of trespass is commenced or prose, cuted against the executor or administrator of the trespasser, the plain‘ tiff shall be entitled to recover only for the value of the goods taken,

the injured party.

Snow. 10. When the executor or administrator of a trustee,
carrier, depositary, or other person, who claimed only a special property in any goods, to hold them for the use and benefit of another,
shall recover such goods, or damages for the taking or detention
thereof, in an action of replevin, or 'trover, or trespass, the goods or
money so recovered shall not be considered as assets in his hands,
but shall, after deducting the costs and expenses of the suit, be paid
over and delivered to the person, for whose use and benefit they were
so held or claimed by the deceased person.

SEC. 11. When judgment for a return, in an action of replevin,
shall be rendered against an executor or administrator, the goods returned by him shall not be considered as assets in his hands ; and if
they shall have been included in the inventory, it shall be a suflicient
discharge for the executor or administrator, to show that they have
been returned, in pursuance of such judgment.

SEC. 12. When there are several plaintiffs or defendants in any
personal action, the cause of which survives, either by the common
law or by the provisions of this chapter, and any of them shall die
before final judgment, the action shall proceed at the suit of the surviving plaintiff, or against the surviving defendant, as the case may be.

Snow. 13. If, in such a case, all the plaintiffs, or all the defendants shall die, the action may be prosecuted or defended by or
against the executor or administrator of the last surviving plaintiff or
defendant, respectively, in like manner as if the survivor had been
originally the only plaintiff or defendant.

Snow. 14. In all real and mixed actions, if the demandant shall
die before final judgment, his heir, at the same term when the death
is suggested, or within such further time as the court shall allow, may
appear and prosecute the suit, in the same manner as if it had been
originally commenced by him.

SEC. 15. If there are several demandants in such an action,

surviving demandants, or if there is no motion fdr the admission of
another person as heir, at the term when the death of the deceased
party is suggested, or within such further time as the court shall allow. the surviving demandants may prosecute the suit, for so much
of the premises in question, as may then be claimed by them.

SE01‘. 17. When there are several tenants in any real or mixed
action, and any of them shall die before final judgment, the action

preceding sections, shall be had in all petitions and actions for partition of lands, in case of the death of any of the parties, except as is
provided in the two following sections.

Si-:c'r. 19. If, upon the death of either of several plaintiffs or

petitioners, in a suit for partition, the interest of the deceased party i

shall pass to the surviving plaintiffs or petitioners, or to any person,
who shall be admitted to join them in the suit, it shall be prosecuted
accordingly, in the manner before provided respecting real actions ;
but if the interest of the deceased party shall pass to any person, who
is not so admitted as a plaintiff or petitioner, such person may, by
order of the court, be made a defendant or respondent, and the
same proceedings may be had a ainst him, as would have been necessary to make him an original defendant or respondent.

SEC. 20. If, upon the death of either of several defendants or
respondents, the interest of the deceased party shall pass to the surviving defendants or respondents, the suit may proceed against them
without any new process; but if the interest of the deceased party
shall pass to any other person, that person may be made a defendant
or respondent, by order of the court, in the manner prescribed in the
preceding section.

SEC. 21. If any action or suit is brought by an unmarried woman, either alone, or jointly with others, and she shall be married

plaintiffs, if there be any, in like manner as if he had originally joined
in the suit.

SEC. 22. If, during the pendency of any action or suit, either
party shall become insane, the action may be prosecuted or defended
by his guardian, in like manner as if it had been commenced after
the appointment of the guardian, or the court may appoint a guardian
for the suit, as the case may require.

Si-:c'r. 23. VVhen an action is brought by or in the name of any
public officer, or by any trustee appointed by virtue of any statute,
his death or removal shall not abate the writ, but it may be prosecuted
by his successor, provided there be a successor, who might have
originally commenced and prosecuted the like action.

SEC. 24. In all the cases mentioned in this chapter, when any
change shall happen in a suit after its commencement, the court may
allow such amendments of the declaration and other pleadings, and
such suggestions to be entered on the record, as circumstances may
require.

form heretofore used, except as is hereinafter provided.

SEC. 3. It shall not be necessary, in the writ of review, to recite at length the declaration and other proceedings in the original
suit, but the writ may be substantially as follows, to wit: to summon
A. to answer to B. “ in the review of an action brought by the said
A. against the said B., in a plea of the case on promises,” or “ in a
plea of debt,” or “ of trespass,” or “ of covenant,” as the case may
be ; “ in which action the said A. by the consideration of the justices
of our court of common pleas, begun and held at C. within and for
our said county of M. on the -— day of —, recovered judgment
against the said B. for the sum of one hundred dollars debt,” or “damages, and ten dollars costs, which said judgment the said B. says is
wrong and erroneous ;” or the former judgment may be briefly described in any other manner that shall be deemed sufficiently certain,
according to such rules as the courts shall prescribe.

SE01‘. 4. The plaintiff in review shall produce and file in court
certified copies of the writ and judgment, and of all proceedings in
the former suit, and the originals or copies of all depositions and other papers, used and filed therein.

SEC. 5. The writ of review shall be served in the same manner as an original writ, except, that when the defendant in review is

not an inhabitant of the state, or not found therein, the writ may be

served on the person who appeared as his attorney in the original
suit, and the court in such case may continue the cause, as they shall
think necessary or proper, to enable the absent party to appear and
answer to the writ of review.

Snow. 6. If the writ of review is sued out by the original plaintiff, he may cause the defendant’s goods and estate to be attached, in
the same manner as might have been done in the original action, and
for this purpose the writ of review may be so framed, as to require
an attachment in the common form, and also to require that the defendant be summoned.

SEC. 7. If an issue of fact was joined in the original suit, the
cause shall be tried on the review upon the same issue, except, that
the court may, upon the review, allow amendments of the original
declaration and other pleadings, in the same manner as might have
been done in the original suit, and if any other or different issue shall
be joined in consequence of such amendment, the cause shall be tried
upon such new issue.

SE01‘. 8. If the former judgment was rendered u on the default
of the defendant or otherwise, without the joining olp an issue, the
parties shall plead upon the review, in like manner as they might and

upon any issue of fact or law that shall be 'oined upon such pleadings,
in like manner as if it had been joined in the original suit.

SE01‘. 9. Upon the trial of any issue of fact upon such review,
each party may produce any legal evidence, whether produced in the
former suit or not, and the cause shall proceed and be disposed of

like manner as if it were an original suit.

S1—:c'r. 10. Judgment shall be given upon the review, as the me- ;
rits of the case upon law and the evidence shall appear to require, although it should be more advantageous than the original judgment was
to the defendant in review, in like manner as if both parties had
brought their several writs of review.

Snow. 11. The party prevailing in the review shall recover his
costs of that suit, but this shall not prevent the court, when granting I
a review upon petition, from imposing on the petitioner such terms
as to costs, as they shall think reasonable.

SEC. 12. The execution of the original judgment shall not be i
stayed or superseded by the writ of review, unless by the order of
the court, and upon security given by the plaintiff in review, as hereinafter provided ; and no attachment made, or bail taken, in the original suit, shall be held liable to satisfy the judgment that shall be rendered on the review.

SEC. 13. If any sum is recovered by the plaintiff in the original
suit for debt or damages, and that sum is reduced on the review, the
original defendant shall have judgment and execution for the difference with his costs, or if the former judgment has not been satisfied,
one judgment may be set off against the other, and an execution shall
issue for the balance.

SEC. 14. If the original plaintiff shall recover on the review a i
greater sum for debt or damages than was awarded to him in the ori- ‘
ginal suit, he shall have judgment and execution for the excess.

I

thing contained in this chapter, like a plaintiff in other actions, so far
as it respects the damages, if any, that maybe awarded to him, either
in the original suit or upon the review.

SEC. 16. If judgment is recovered against several defendants in
the original action, any one or more of them may review the cause,
in like manner as if he or they had been the only defendants therein ;
and if the sum, recovered in the original suit for debt or damages, shall
be increased or reduced on the review, the court shall take such order respecting the further proceedings, as shall be necessary to carry
into effect the two judgments, according to the rights of all the different parties.

SEC. 17. When judgment is rendered, as provided in the nine: ty second chapter, upon the default of a defendant, who is out of the

state, he may, at any time within one year after the judgment, sue
out, as of right, and without any petition therefor, a writ of review
thereof, in the manner provided in this chapter, which writ shall be
sued out of the court in which the judgment was rendered ; and no
writ of review shall be issued in any other case, unless it shall be allowed upon petition, as hereinafter provided.

SEC. 18. If a review, in the case mentioned in the preceding
SECion, is not prosecuted as of right, the-supreme judicial court may,

judicial court or the court of common pleas, in any civil action, whether upon verdict, or report of referees, or upon a nonsuit or default,

review be filed within the time prescribed in the following section.

absence of the petitioner, and without his knowledge, the petition for
review may be filed at any time within one year after he shall first
have notice of the judgment, otherwise it shall be filed within one
year after the judgment was rendered.

SEC. 21. The petition may be filed before the court, when sitting in any county, and the order of notice issued thereon may be
made returnable in such county as the court shall in the same order
direct ; but the review, if granted, shall be bad in the county in which
the former judgment was rendered, or in the county in which the
original action would have been tried, if it had been carried to the
supreme judicial court by appeal or otherwise.

S1-:c'r. 22. If the execution in the original action has not been
satisfied, the court may order a stay or supersedeas thereof, upon
security, given by the petitioner to the adverse party, to pay whatever
shall appear to be due to him, after the final judgment in the review,
or upon such other terms, as the court shall think just and reasonable.

SEC. 23. Such stay or supersedeas of the execution may be ordered, upon the petition of the plaintiff in review, as well when a

writ of review is demandable of right, as when it is grantable at the
discretion of the court.

SE01‘. 24. If, upon any such petition, the review shall not be
granted, the court may award to the respondent his reasonable costs
for appearing and answering thereto.

the petition for such review, and upon the trial thereof, if the review
be granted, shall be conducted in the same manner as is prescribed in

SECION 1. When the defendant, in any action founded on con’ tract, shall plead in abatement the nonjoinder of any other person as

defendant, the court may, at any time before issue joined on such plea,
allow the plaintiff, on such terms as they shall prescribe, to amend
his declaration, by inserting therein the name of any other person as
defendant, and declaring against him jointly with the original defendant. .

SE01‘. 2. The plaintiff may thereupon take out a new writ, in
such form as the court shall‘ prescribe, which shall be in the nature of
an original writ of capias and attachment, or of summons, and shall
require the new defendant to appear and answer as a defendant in the
original action, and upon such writ, the new defendant’s body may
be arrested, or his goods or estate may be attached, as upon an original writ, and the writ shall be returnable at such time as the court
shall order, and shall be served fourteen days at least before the return day.

SE01‘. 3. Upon the return of such new writ, every person,
named therein as a defendant, shall be bound to appear and answer
with the other defendants, in the same manner as if they had all been
originally made arties in the first writ.

Saar. 4. If) a legal service cannot be made on any such new defendant, by reason of his absence from the state, or for other suflicient cause, the action may nevertheless proceed against all the defendants, who are duly served with process, either on the original or
the new writ, in like manner as is provided in the ninety second
chapter, when one of several original defendants is not duly served
with process.

Snow. 5. Judgment shall be rendered, and execution shall issue,
in every such case, for either party, in the same manner as if the
original writ had been issued against all the defendants ; and the plaintiff shall have the same benefit of any attachment made, or bail taken,
upon each of the said writs, as if the same had been made or taken in
the usual manner upon the original writ.

Snow. 6. When any action, founded on contract, is brought
against several persons, and any of the defendants shall be defaulted,
or shall confess the action, the plaintiff may amend his declaration,
and take judgment against those defendants, in like manner as if they
had been sued alone, and the action may be discontinued against the
other defendants, who shall be entitled to costs against the plaintiff,
as in case of a nonsuit; provided, that no such discontinuance and
amendment shall be allowed, without notice to the defendants who
have been defaulted, that they may appear and object thereto, if they
shall see fit.

Sacr. 7. When any action, founded on contract, is brought
against several persons, the plaintiff may be allowed, at any time before the cause is argued to the jury, and if there is no such argument, 1
at any time before it is committed to the jury by the court, to discon- 'T
tinue, as against any of the defendants, upon payment of costs to them, A
as in case of a nonsuit, and on such other terms as the court shall direct ; and the plaintiff may thereupon amend his declaration, and proceed against the other defendants, in like manner as if the action had
been originally brought against them alone; and the defendants, against
whom the cause has been discontinued, may be thereupon examined
as witnesses for either party, if in other respects competent.

SEC. 8. In all actions, brought for breach of the condition of a bond, or to recover a penalty for the non-performance of any covenant, contract, or agreement, when it shall appear by verdict, default,
confession, or otherwise, that the condition is broken, or the penalty
forfeited, judgment shall be entered in the common form for the penal
sum, but no execution shall issue thereon, except as is provided in
the following sections.

SEC. 9. The court shall award an execution, in such case, for I
so much of the penal sum, as shall then be due and payable in equity 7
and good conscience, for the breach of the condition, or other non- r
performance of the contract ; which sum shall be ascertained and determined by the court, unless either party shall move to have it assessed by ajury, or unless the court shall think proper to have the
question so decided ; in which cases, the sum so due shall be assessed by a jury.

SEC. 10. If any further sum shall afterwards become due on
such bond or other contract, the plaintiff or his executors or administrators may have a scire facias on the judgment, from the court in
which it was rendered, against the original defendant, or his executors,
administrators, heirs, devisees, or assigns, as the case may be, suggesting such further breaches of the contract as shall have occurred,
and summoning the adverse party to show cause why execution
should not be awarded upon the judgment, for the damages caused by
such further breaches.

Snow. 11. The sum due in such suit shall be assessed and determined in the same manner as in the original suit, and execution
shall be awarded accordingly, and the like proceedings may be repeated, upon occasion of any further breaches of the same contract,
as often as they shall occur, until the whole of the penalty is exhausted.

SEC. 12. Nothing herein contained shall prevent any person
from bringing an action, for the breach of any covenant or other contract, instead of suing for the penalty by which the performance of
the covenant or contract may have been secured.

SEC. 13. The supreme judicial court may, by general rules,
prescribe the mode of declaring in actions on bonds, or other contracts with penalties, and may allow or require the breaches, for
which the action is brought, to be set forth in the declaration, or suggested on the record, in such cases, as shall be found expedient and
useful.

SEC. 14. The payment or tender of payment of the whole sum,
due on any contract for the payment of money, although made after
the money has become due and payable, may he pleaded to an action
subsequently brought, in like manner and with the like effect, as if

such payment or tender had been made at the time prescribed in the
contract.

SEC. 15. A tender may also be made, after an action is brought
on such contract, of the whole sum due thereon, with the legal costs
of suit incurred up to that time, provided it be made four days at least
before the return day of the original writ.

SEC. 16. The tender last mentioned may be made either to the
plaintiff, or to his attorney in the suit, and if not accepted, the defendant may plead it, in like manner as if it had been made before the
commencement of the action, bringing into court the amount so tendered for costs, as well as for the debt or damages.

SEC. 17. If such tender is accepted, the plaintiff or his attori ney shall, at the request of the defendant, sign a certificate or notice

thereof to the officer, who hastbe writ, and shall deliver it to the defendant; and if any further costs shall be incurred, for any service
made by the officer, after the tender and before he receives notice
thereof, the defendant shall pay the same to the officer, or the tender
shall be invalid.

SEC. 18. When a defendant shall plead two or more pleas in
his defence, no averment, confession, or acknowledgment, contained
in any one of such pleas, shall be used or taken as evidence against
him, on the trial of any issue joined on any other of the same leas.

SEC. 19. If the defendant, in any action for slander, or gr publishing a libel, shall plead in his justification that the words spoken or
published were true, such plea, though not maintained by the evidence, shall not in any case be of itself proof of the malice alleged in
the declaration.

SEC. 20. Whenever, in any declaration or other pleading, it
shall be necessary to mention or refer to any general statute, it may
be done by specifying the chapter, containing the provision referred
to, or by mentioning in general terms the subject of the statute, or by
referring to it in some other manner that shall indicate, with sufficient
certainty, the statute that is intended.

SEC. 21. No writ, process, declaration, or other proceeding in
the courts, or course of justice, shall be abated, arrested, quashed or
reversed, for any circumstantial errors or mistakes, when the person
and case may be rightly understood by the court, nor through defect
or want of form only.

SEC. 22. The court, in which any civil action is pending, may,
at any time before judgment rendered therein, allow amendments,
either in form or substance, of any process, pleading, or proceeding
in such action, on such terms as shall be just and reasonable.

SEC. 23. After judgment rendered in any civil action, any defects or imperfections in matter of form, found in the record or proceedings in the action, may be rectified and amended by the court in

be removed by writ of error, if substantial justice requires it, and if

by the person with whom the contract was made.

St-:c'r. 26. In every action brought against any justice of the
peace, sheriff, coroner, town officer, or any other public o$cer, civil
or military, for or concerning any act done by him, by virtue of his

for anything done by him, by command of such officer, or in his aid
or assistance in the execution of his office, the defendant may plead

entry under his title, but if he shall prove that he is entitled to such
an estate, as he claims in the premises, whether as heir, devisee, purchaser or otherwise, and also that he has a right of entry therein, this

premises.

SE01‘. 7. If the person in possession shall have actually ousted
the demandant, or withheld from him the possession of the premises,
he may, at the election of the demandant, be considered as a disseizor,
for the purpose of trying the right, although he should claim therein
an estate less than a freehold.

S1’-:c'r. 8. Every suit, upon such writ of entry, shall be prosecuted and conducted in the same manner as if the demandant had, at
the time of commencing the action, made an actual entry on the demanded premises, and had been immediately ousted by the tenant;
so that on a trial upon the general issue, if the demandant shall prove
that he is entitled to such estate in the premises, as is set forth in the
declaration, and that he had a right of entry on the day, when the action was commenced, he shall recover the premises, unless the tenant
shall prove a better title in himself.

SE01‘. 9. The law and the practice, relating to the pleadings and
evidence, in the said action or writ of entry on disseizin, as now recognized and established, shall continue in force, except so far as they

liable, shall be the clear annual value of the premises, for the time

those under whom he claims, shall not be computed nor allowed to

the demandant.
SEC. 18. The tenant shall never be liable for the rents and profits for any longer term than six years, nor for any waste or other damage committed before that time, unless when the rents and profits

in the manner hereinafter provided, for the value of any buildings or
improvements made or erected on the premises by himself, or by
any person under whom he claims.

SEC. 20. The tenant shall also be entitled to the like compensation, although the premises should not have been so held so long

SEC. 21. When the tenant in the action claims allowance for
any such improvements, he shall enter on the record a suggestion of

ascertained and allowed to him, in case judgment shall be rendered
for the demandant.

' SECT. 22. The suggestion shall be entered at the same term with
the plea, if any, made by the tenant, unless the court shall, for sumcient reasons, allow it to be made afterwards, and if judgment is rendered for the demandant, on default or otherwise, without any plea,
the suggestion shall be entered at such seasonable stage of the proceedings, as the court shall prescribe or allow.

SEC. 23. If any issue of fact is tried in the case and found for
the demandant, the jury shall at the same time ascertain and deter, mine the sum to be allowed to the tenant for such improvements, unless it shall be otherwise ordered by the court, as provided in the following section.

Snow. 24. If it shall appear to the court, on the motion of either
party, that it would be more convenient to postpone the assessment
of the sums due respectively to the demandant for the rents and profits or other damages, or to the tenant for improvements, until after
the trial of the title and a verdict thereon, the court may make an order for that purpose, at any time before the verdict on the title is recorded.

Sam. 25. If the assessment of the sums due to either party is so
postponed, or if there is no issue of fact tried in the cause, and judgment is to be rendered for the demandant on demurrer, default or
otherwise, the said sums shall be assessed by the court, unless either
party shall move to have them assessed by a jury, or unless the court

shall think proper to have them so assessed, in which cases a

of the court for his use ; and the demandant shall not be entitled to
recover against the tenant, or any person claiming under him, any
rents and profits that shall accrue after the judgment, and before he

for improvements, but in such case he shall not be liable to repay the
excess, if any, of the rents and profits beyond the value of the improvements.

demandant from maintaining an action of trespass for mesne profits, ,

tenant in the writ of entry, who may have had possession of the premises, or may be otherwise liable to such action.

SEC. 32. When the tenant in the action shall claim allowance
for improvements, as before provided, the demandant may, by a like i
entry on the record, require that the value of his estate in the de- 7
manded premises, without the improvements, shall also be ascertain- :
ed and determined.

SEC. 33. The value of the premises in such case shall be estimated, as it would have been at the time of the inquiry, if no such

the manner following.

SEC1‘. 38. The said price shall be paid in three equal instalments, with interest annually, the first instalment to be paid on or
before the expiration of one year from the time when the demandant’s
election to relinquish the premises shall be entered on the record,

years from the time before mentioned, and the third instalment to be
paid on or before the expiration of three years from the same time.

writ of seizin on the judgment recovered by him, and shall take and
hold the premises, without allowance for any improvements that may
have been made thereon.

paid for the premises, as so much money had and received by such
demandant in his life time, for the use of the plaintiff, with lawful
interest therefor, ‘from the time of such payment.

SEC. 42. If the tenant, or the person holding under him, when
impleaded in such second action for the recovery of the premises,
shall give notice thereof to the person, who is so liable to refund the
purchase money, and shall permit such person to defend the action,
the judgment, if rendered against the tenant in the action, shall be
conclusive as to his right to recover the amount so paid for the
premises.

SI-:cT. 43. If the person impleaded does not give such notice to
the other party, and permit him to defend the suit, the latter shall be
permitted, in the suit afterwards brought against him for the price
paid for the premises, to deny the title upon which the second recovery was had, and the party so evicted shall not recover the said
price, unless he shall prove that he was evicted by force of a better
title than that of the original demandant.

his executors or administrators, or by any person who is entitled to
the estate under him, to the demandant or his executors or administrators, in like manner and with the like effect, as if both parties were
living; and any money payable by the demandant may be paid by

be issued in the name of the original demandant against the original
tenant, although either or both of them be dead, and when executed,

executed on the day when the judgment was rendered.

SEC. 46. If the demandant in a writ of entry shall claim an
estate for life only in the premises, and if he shall pay any sum allowed to the tenant for improvements, he or his executors or administrators, at the determination of his estate, shall be entitled to receive of
the remainder-man or reversioner the value of the said improvements,
as they then exist, and shall have a lien therefor on the premises, in
like manner as if they had been mortgaged for the payment thereof,
and may keep possession thereof accordingly, until the sum be paid.

Saar. 47. If the amount, so due from the remainder-man or reversioner, shall not be agreed on by the parties, it may be ascertained and determined, as is provided for the redemption of a tnortgage,
upon a bill in equity, to be brought by the remainder-man or reversioner as mortgagor; and the like proceedings shall be had, as are
prescribed in that case, for ascertaining the sum due for redemption
of the premises, and for the recovery thereof by the remainder-man
or reversioner.

Snow. 48. The remainder-man or reversioner, or those claiming
under him, shall not, in such case, be limited to the three years prescribed for the redemption of a mortgage, but they shall not, in any
case, be entitled to recover from the adverse party any balance in
money, although the rents and profits of the premises, which accrued
after the determination of the estate for life, exceed the amount due
for the improvements. .

Snow. 49. The remainder-man or reversioner, and those claiming under him, shall, in such case, be considered as disseized at the
time of the determination of the life estate, so far as to bar their bill
in equity, and all other remedy by action or by entry, for the recovery of the premises, after the expiration of the time prescribed for
the limitation of the right of entry and of action, in cases of disseizin.

estimated value of the premises without the improvements, shall extend or apply to any action, brought by a mortgagee or his heirs or

assigns against a mortgagor or his heirs or assigns, for the recovery of
the mortgaged premises.

to him such part of the premises, if any, as he shall appear to be entitled to.

St-:c'r. 18. If, upon such a trial, or upon the fault [default] of the
respondent, or otherwise, it shall appear that the petitioner is entitled
to have partition, whether for the share or proportion claimed in his
petition, or for any less share, the court shall award the interlocutory
judgment, that partition shall be made.

SBc'r. 19. Upon such a judgment, rendered in the court of common pleas, either party may appeal to the supreme judicial court;
and the cause shall be there heard and determined, and the proceedings therein shall be conducted, in like manner, as in appeals in other
suits.

SEC. 20. When partition is to be made, the court shall appoint
three or five disinterested persons as commissioners, to make the
partition, and to set off to the petitioner or petitioners, the share or
shares belonging to them, which shall be expressed in the warrant.

SE01‘. 2] If there are several petitioners, they may have their

shares set off together, or the share of each one may be set of in severalty, at their election.

St-:c'r. 22. The commissioners, before proceeding to the execution of their duties, shall be sworn, before any justice of the peace,
faithfully and impartially to execute the same, a certificate of which
oath shall be made on the warrant, by the person who administered it.

SEC. 23. The commissioners shall give sufficient notice of the
time and place, appointed for making the partition, to all persons interested therein, who are known and within the state, that they may
be resent at the making thereof.

£5101‘. 24. All the commissioners shall meet for the performance
of any of their duties, but the acts of a majority of them shall be
valid.

SEC. 25. When the premises, of which partition is demanded,
consist of a mill or other tenement which cannot be divided without
damage to the owners, or when any specific part of the estate is of

‘greater value than either party’s share, and cannot be divided without

damage to the owners, the whole estate, or the part thereof so incapable of division, may be set off to any one of the parties, who will
accept it, be paying to any one or more of the others, such sums of
money as the commissioners shall award, to make the partition just and
equal ; but the partition, in such case, shall not be established by the
court, until all the sums so awarded shall be paid to the parties entitled thereto, or secured to their satisfaction.

SEC. 26. In the case mentioned in the preceding section, the
commissioners, instead of setting off the premises, or a part thereof,
in the manner therein provided, may assign the exclusive occupancy
and enjoyment of the whole, or the part, as the case may be, to each
of the parties, alternately, for certain specified times, in proportion
to their respective interests therein.

SEC. 27. When the whole or any specific part of the premises
is assigned, in the manner provided in the preceding section, the
person, entitled for the time being to the exclusive occupancy, shall
be liable to his co-tenants for any injury to the premises, occasioned
by his misconduct, in like manner and to the like extent, as a tenant
for years under a common lease, without express covenants, would
be liable to his landlord, and the other tenants in common may have
their remedy therefor against him, by an action on the case, either
jointly or severally, at their election.

SEC. 28. Whilst any estate is in the exclusive occupancy of
any co-tenant, under such an assignment as before mentioned, he
shall be entitled to the same remedy against any person, who shall
trespass upon, or otherwise injure the ‘premises, as if he held the
same under a lease for the same term, or which they were so assigned to him, and he and all the other tenants in common shall also
be entitled to recover, against the wrongdoer, such other and further
damages, as they shall have sustained by the same trespass or injury,
in like manner, as if the premises had been leased by them, for the
term aforesaid; and all joint damages, recovered by any such tenants in common, by force of this or the preceding section, shall be
apportioned and divided among them, according to their respective
rights, by the court in which the judgment is recovered.

Snow. 29. The commissioners shall makea return of their doings

» under their hands, together with their warrant, to the court which appointed them, and if their doings are confirmed by the court, judgment shall be thereupon rendered, that the said partition be firm and
effectual forever ; and the return shall then be recorded in the clerk’s
ofiice, and also in the registry of deeds for the county where the
lands lie.

SEC. 30. The court may, for any sufiicient reason, set aside the
return and commit the case anew to the same or to other commissioners, to be appointed as aforesaid, whereupon the same proceeding shall be had as are before directed.

St=:c'r. 31. If the judgment, upon the report of the commissioners, is rendered in the court of common pleas, either party may appeal therefrom to the supreme judicial court, and the proceedings
thereupon shall be conducted in ike tnanner as in appeals in other
suits, excepting, that upon this appeal, the interlocutory judgment,
awarding that partition be made, shall not be drawn in question.

SEC. 32. The same regulations, which are herein prescribed,

' as to appeals from the first and the second judgment, on a petition for

partition, shall apply and be enforced, in like manner, in the case of a
writ of partition.
SEC. 33. The final judgment, confirming and establishing the

' partition, shall be conclusive as to all rights, both of property and of

possession, of all parties and privies to the judgment, including all
persons, who might by law have appeared and answered to the petition, except as is hereinafter provided.

SEC. 34. If any person, who was a part owner with the petitioner, and for whom a share is left upon the partition, should be out
of the state, when the summons or notice to him is served, and
should not return, in time to appear and answer to the suit, he may at
any time, within three years after the final judgment, apply to the same
court for a new partition of the premises.

SEC. 35. If upon such an application, and after a hearing of all
parties interested therein, it shall appear to the court that the share
left for the applicant was less than he was entitled to, or that the part
left for hint was not, at the time of the partition, equal in value to his
share of the premises, they may order a new partition thereof, which
shall be made in the manner before provided.

St-:c'r. 36. In such new partition, the commissioners shall not be
required to make a new division of the whole premises, but they
may take from any one share or shares, and add to any other or
others, so much as shall in their judgment be necessary to make the
partition just and equal, estimating the whole as in the state in which
it was when first divided; or, if an equal partition of the lands cannot be made, without inconvenience to the owners, the commissioners
may award money to be paid by one party to another as before provided, to equalize the shares.

SEC. 37. If, after the first partition, any improvements shall
have been made on any part of the premises, which, by the new partition, shall be taken from the share of the party who made the improvements, he shall be entitled to compensation therefor, to be estimated and awarded by the commissioners, and to be paid by the

party, to whom such part of the premises shall be assigned, on the
new partition, and the court may issue an execution therefor in the
common form.

SEC. 38. If any person, who has not appeared and answered to
the petition for partition, shall claim to hold in severalty the premises
therein mentioned, or any part thereof, he shall not be concluded by
the judgment for partition, but may bring his action, for the land
claimed by him, against any'or all of the petitioners or respondents, or
of the persons holding under them, as the case may require, within
the same time, in which he might have brought it, if no such judgment
for partition had been rendered.

S1-:c'r. 39. When any person, who has not appeared and answered as aforesaid, shall claim the share that was assigned to, or left for,
any of the supposed part owners, in the judgment for partition, he
shall be concluded by the judgment, so far as it respects the partition,
and the assignment of the shares, in like manner as if he had been a
party to that suit,but he shall not be prevented thereby from bringing
his action, for the share claimed by him, against the person to whom
it was assigned, or for whom it was left.

SEC. 40. The action in such case shall be brought against the
tenant in possession, in like manner as if the demandant had originally
claimed the specific piece demanded, instead of an undivided part of
the whole land, and it may be brought within the same time in which

it might have been brought, if no such judgment for partition had been
rendered.

n.-.—. A

Saar. 41. If two or more persons appear as respondents, claim- »

ing the same share of the premises to be divided, it shall not be necessary to decide on their respective claims, except only for the purpose of determining which of them shall be ‘admitted to appear and
plead in the suit ; and if partition is made, the share so claimed shall
be left for whichever of the said parties shall prove to be entitled to
it, in a suit to be thereafter brought between themselves.

SEC. 42. If, in such a case, it shall be decided in the original
suit for partition,upon the replication of the petitioner, or otherwise,
that either of the said respondents is not entitled to the share that he
claims, he shall be concluded by the judgment, so far as it respects
the partition, and the assignment of the shares; but he shall not be
prevented thereby from bringing his action, for the share claimed by
him, against the other claimant thereof, in the manner provided in
the three preceding sections.

SEC. 43. If any person, who has not appeared and answered as
aforesaid, shall claim any part of the premises mentioned in the petition, as a part owner with those who were parties to that suit, or any
of them, and if the part or share so claimed was not known, or not
allowed and left for him, in the process for partition, he shall be concluded by the judgment, so far as it respects the partition; but he
shall not be prevented thereby from bringing an action, for the share
or proportion claimed by him, against each of the persons, who shall
hold any part of the premises, under the judgment for partition.

SEC. 44. If the demandant shall prevail, in the case last mentioned, he shall not be entitled to demand a new partition of the whole
premises, but he shall recover against each of the persons, holding

under the judgment for partition, the same proportion or share of the
part held by him, that the demandant was entitled to claim out of the
whole premises, before the partition thereof.

SI-:c'r. 45. If, after the making of partition, it shall appear that
any person, for whom a share was left, or to whom a share was assigned, had died before the partition was made, the heir or devisee
of such deceased person shall not, by reason of his having been a
party to the suit, either as a petitioner or a respondent, be barred
from claiming the share, that belonged to the deceased person ; but
the heir or devisee, in such case, shall have the same rights and the
same remedies, in all respects, as if he had not been a party to the
suit, and had not had notice of the pendency thereof.

SEC. 46. If any person, to or for whom any share shall have
been assigned or left, upon any judgment for partition, shall be evicted
thereof by any person, who, at the time of ' the partition, had a title
thereto, older and better than the title of those who were parties to
the suit for partition, the person so evicted shall be entitled to a new
partition of the residue, in like manner as if the former partition had
not been made.

SEC. 47. Any person, having a mortgage, attachment, or other
lien, on the share of any part owner, shall be concluded by the judgment, so far as it respects the partition and the assignment of the
shares, but his lien shall remain in full force upon the part, that shall
be assigned to, or left for, such part owner.

SEC. 48. In case of the death of any party in a petition for
partition, the suit shall not abate, but shall be conducted and prosecuted, in the manner provided in the ninety third chapter.

SEC. 49. The expenses and charges of the commissioners shall
be ascertained and allowed by the court, and all the other costs of
the proceeding shall be taxed in the usual manner, and the whole shall
be paid by the petitioner, except only the costs of a trial of any issue

joined in the case, as to which a different provision is before made ;

and when there is more than one petitioner, the whole costs and
charges, that are payable by them, shall be paid in proportion to the
shares or interests that they respectively hold in the premises.

St-:c'r. 50. The probate court, in which the estate of any deceased person is settled, or in a course of settlement, may make partition of all his real estate, lying within the state, among his heirs or
devisees, and all persons holding under them, in the manner and under the restrictions hereinafter provided.

SEC. 51. The partition shall be made by three or live disinterested persons, to be appointed as commissioners for that purpose by

t the judge of probate, and they shall, before proceeding to the execution of their duties, be sworn before the said judge or before any justice of the peace, faithfully and impartially to execute the same, and
shall proceed therein, in the manner before prescribed with regard to
commissioners appointed by the supreme judicial court, or the court
of common pleas, except as is hereinafter otherwise provided.

SEC. 52. If there is estate to be divided, lying in different
counties, the judge of probate may, if he shall think (it, issue a separate warrant, and appoint different commissioners, for each county ;
and the partition in such case shall be made of the estate in each
county, in like manner as if there were no other estate to be divided

Snow. 53. Such partition may be ordered on the petition of any i
of the said parties interested, after due notice to all the others to ap- ]
pear and show cause against it ; which notice shall be served, fourteen '
days at least before the time appointed for the hearing, on the said
parties personally, if they can be found within the state, and if not,
the notice shall be given by publishing it, in such newspapers as the
court shall order, once in each week for three weeks at least before
such hearing.

Snow. 54. If it shall appear to the court that any infant or Insane <
person is interested in the premises, and has no guardian within the f
state, the court shall assign him a guardian for the suit, to appear for ,
him and defend his interests therein, in the same manner as a guardian is admitted for an infant defendant, in actions at the common law.

SEC. 55. The partition, when made on the application of an
heir, shall be made of all the estate, that descended from the ancestor, and which any party interested, whether the applicant or others, i
shall require to have included in the partition, and when made on
the application of a devisee, it shall be made of all the estate, held by
the applicant jointly or in common with others holding under the
testator, which he or any other devisee shall require to have included;
and the same rule shall apply, when the application is made by any
person, holding under an heir or devisee.

SI-ZCT. 56. Upon every such partition, the court shall not only
assign and set off to the applicant his share in the premises, that are
to be divided, but shall also cause the residue thereof, to be divided
among the parties interested therein, and the share of each one to be
assigned to him, unless any two or more of the parties shall consent
to hold their shares together and undivided.

SEC. 57. When any messuage, piece of land, or other part of
the premises, of which partition is to be made, is of greater value
than either party’s share, and cannot be divided without great inconvenience to the owners, the same may be set off to any one of the
parties, who will accept it, be paying to any one or more of the
others, such sums of money as the commissioners shall award, to
make the partition just and equal ; but the partition in such case shall
not be established by the court, until all the sums so awarded shall be
paid to the parties entitled thereto, or secured to their satisfaction.

SEC. 58. In the assignment of any part of the premises, as provided in the preceding section, males shall be preferred to females,
and among the children of the deceased, elder shall be preferred to
younger sons.

Snow. 59. The court may, for any sufhcient reason, set aside
the return of the commissioners, and commit the case anew to the
same or to other commissioners; and the return, when finally accepted and confirmed by the court, shall be recorded in the probate
otiice, and also in the registry of deeds for the county in which the
lands lie.

SEC. 60. The expenses and charges, incurred in making the
partition, shall be ascertained and allowed by the court, and shall be
paid by all the parties interested in the partition, in pro ortion to their
respective shares or interests in the premises; andi any one shall
neglect to pay the part assessed on him by the court, an execution

therefor in common form may be issued against him, in favor of the

person or persons entitled thereto.
SEC. 61. No partition shall be made by the probate court, when

the shares or proportions of the respective parties are in dispute between them, or shall appear to the judge to be uncertain, depending

- upon the construction or effect of any devise or other conveyance, or

upon any other questions, that he shall think proper for the consideration of a jury and a court of common law.

SEC. 62. All questions, as to any advancement made or alleged
to be made by the deceased to any heir, may be heard and determined

' by the judge of probate, saving an appeal, as in other cases, to the

supreme court ; and the final decree or sentence, if any is made thereon, shall be binding on all parties interested in the estate, whether the
partition is made by the probate court, or by writ or petition in the
courts of common law. .

SEc'r. 63. If any writ or petition shall be brought in the courts
of common law, for partition among co-heirs, and either party shall
allege, that an advancement has been made to any other party, the
court may hear and determine the question concerning the advancement, or they may suspend their proceedings in the suit for partition,
until that question shall be decided in the probate court, in which the
estate of the deceased is settled.

SEC. 64. When the real estate of the deceased, or any part of
it, shall lie in common and undivided with that of any other person,
the probate court may cause it to be divided and set off from the part
held by such co-tenant, before making partition thereof among the
heirs or others claiming under the deceased.

SEC. 65. The court, in such case, shall order notice of the intended partition to be given to the co-tenant, which notice shall contain a description of the premises to be divided, with a statement of
the share or proportion, claimed as belonging to the estate of the deceased, and shall express the time and place, appointed for hearing
the case ; and it shall be served on the co-tenant, by delivering to him
an attested copy thereof, or by leaving such copy at the place of his
abode in this state, fourteen days at least before the time appointed
for the hearing. . _

SEC. 66. If it shall appear, in any stage of the proceedings,
that any person interested in the premises, other than the heirs and
devisees of the deceased, and those claiming under them, was absent
from the state, at the time when the notice was served, and has not
returned, the probate court shall either dismiss the application for partition, or shall stay all further proceedings therein, until such absent
party shall appear and answer thereto, or shall signify in writing, to the
probate court, his consent that partition be made as proposed.

SEC. 67. Any person, aggrieved by any order, sentence, decree, or denial of a judge of probate, in any process of partition, may
appeal therefrom in the manner prescribed in the eighty third chapter.

SEC. 68. The partition, when finally confirmed and established,
shall be conclusive on all the heirs and devisees of the deceased, and
all persons claiming under them: it shall also be conclusive on all
other persons interested in the premises, who shall have appeared and
answered in the case, or who shall have assented to the proposed

partition, as before provided, and also on every person so interested,
on whom notice was served, as before provided, by delivering to him
a copy thereof, or by leaving it at the place of his abode, at a time
when he was within the state.

SEC. 69. Such partition shall not be conclusive upon any persons, other than those mentioned in the preceding section; but all
such other persons may pursue their legal remedies for recovering the
premises, or as much thereof as may belong to them, and also for
obtaining partition thereof, in like manner as if the proceedings in the
probate court had not been had.

Sncr. 70. If, after a partition by the probate court, any improvements shall be made on any part of the premises, which shall afterwards, upon a new partition, in the‘ same or any other court, be assigned to any other person, the party, from whom such part is taken,
shall be entitled to compensation for the improvements thereon, to
be estimated and awarded by the commissioners, who shall make the
second partition, and to be paid by the party, to whom that part of
the premises shall be thereby assigned, and the court may issue an
execution therefor in the common form.

made by any of the courts mentioned in this chapter, shall be considered as holding them under an apparently good title, so that in
case of an eviction, he shall be entitled to compensation for any improvements made-thereon, in the manner prescribed in the one hundred and first chapter.

Sncr. 72. When proceedings for obtaining partition shall have
been lawfully commenced, in either of the courts mentioned in this
chapter, that court shall retain jurisdiction of the case, saving the right
of appeal, in all cases, where an appeal is allowed by law.

the supreme judicial court, or court of common pleas, shall be indorsed in the same manner as is prescribed with respect to original
writs, and all the regulations, concerning the indorsement of original
writs, contained in the ninetieth chapter, shall apply in like manner
to the indorsement of such petitions for partition.

of lands, the tenant or person in possession shall, with the knowledge
of the pendencylof the action, commit any strip or waste thereon, the
demandant, if he recovers judgment in the suit, may afterwards recover, in an action of trespass against the person who committed the

I

waste, three times the amount of the damages that shall be assessed
therefor.

S1-:c'r. 10. If any person shall wilfully cut down, carry away, gir- ;
dle, or otherwise destroy any trees, timber, wood or underwood, on ‘
the land of another person without license therefor, the owner may '
recover, in an action of trespass against him, three times the amount
of the damages that shall be assessed therefor, except as provided in
the following section.

SE01‘. 1 I. If, upon the trial of such an action, it shall appear that
the defendant had good reason to believe that the land on which the
trespass was committed was his own, or that he was otherwise lawfully authorized to do the acts complained of, he shall be liable only
for the single damages assessed therefor.

SEC. 12. When any trespass on lands shall have been casual
and involuntary, the trespasser may tender to the party injured stillicient amends therefor, before any action is brought for the same, and
if afterwards sued for such trespass, he may in his plea disclaim all
title to the land, and allege that the trespass was casual and involuntary, and set forth the tender in the usual form, bringing into court the
money so tendered ; and if upon the trial, the allegations in the plea
shall appear to be true, and the damages assessed for the trespass
shall not exceed the amount so tendered, the defendant shall recover
his costs of the suit.

SEC. 13. If the trespasser, in such a case, shall not have made a
tender before the commencement of the action, he may in his plea
disclaim all title to the land, and allege that the trespass was casual
and involuntary, and bring into court suthcient amends for the trespass, together with the costs of suit up to that time, and if the plaintiff shall not accept the same, in satisfaction of the trespass, and if,
upon the trial, the allegations in the plea shall appear to be true, and
the damages assessed for the trespass shall not exceed the amount
so brought into court, the defendant shall recover his costs of the
Sult.

SEC. 14. The supreme judicial court may hear and determine
in equity all matters concerning waste, in which there is not a plain,
adequate and complete remedy at law, and when it shall be necessary
or proper to have any fact in such a case tried by a jury, it shall be
done in such manner as the court shall direct.

SEC. 15. The said ltourt, or any one of the 'ustices thereof,
may, either in term time or vacation. at any time ter the filing of
the bill in such suit, or other commencement thereof, issue a writ of
injunction, to stay waste on the premises in question, and issue all
such other writs and processes, and make all such orders and decrees
in the case, according to the course of proceedings in chancery, as
justice and equity may require, and as may be necessary or proper to
carry into effect the powers hereby granted.

SEC. 16. Every such injunction ‘to stay waste may be dissolved, either in term time or vacation, by the supreme judicial court,
or by any one of the justices thereof, whenever he or they shall think

civil action, shall do any act of waste thereon, or shall threaten or

make. preparations to commit waste thereon, the court, in which the
suit is pending, or any one of the justices thereof may, on the application of the plaintiff, either in term time or vacation, issue a writ of
injunction to stay such waste.

SE01‘. 18. The same court may arrest and commit the defendant for any violation of such injunction, and issue such other process

manner as the supreme judicial court may do upon a bill in equity
pending before them, and the injunction may be dissolved, either in
term time or vacation, by the court‘in which the suit is pending, or
by any one of the justices thereof, whenever he or they shall think

It proper.

plaintiff prevails, the court may, in addition to the usual judgment for
damages and costs, also enter judgment, that the nuisance be abated
and removed. .

SE01‘. 2. The court, in such a case, may award an execution in
common form, for the damages and costs, and a separate warrant to
the proper officer, requiring him to abate and remove the nuisance,
at the expense of the defendant, in like manner as public and common
nuisances are abated and removed. I

SE01‘. 3. The court may on the motion of the defendant, order
a stay of the said warrant, for any time not exceeding six months, to
give him opportunity to remove the nuisance, upon his undertaking

SE01‘. 4. If the plaintiff shall recover judgment in a second suit,
for the continuance or repetition of the same nuisance, whether there
had been in the first suit a judgment for the abatement and removal
thereof or not, he shall, in such second suit, be entitled as of right to
a judgment for the abatement and removal of the nuisance, and to a
warrant to be issued thereon, as before provided.

SE01‘. 5. The expense of abating and removing the nuisance
shall be collected by the ollicer, in the same manner as damages and
costs are collected upon execution ; except, that the materials of any
buildings, fences, or other things, that shall be removed as a nuisance,
may be sold by the otiicer, in like manner, as goods are sold on execution for the payment of debts ; and the otiicer shall apply the proceeds of such sale to defray the expenses of the removal, and shall
pay over the balance thereof, if any, to the defendant upon demand,
and if the proceeds of the sale are not sutiicient to defray the said expenses, he shall collect the residue thereof as before provided.

SE01‘. 6. The supreme judicial court may hear and determine
in equity, all matters concerning nuisances, in which there is not a
plain, adequate and complete remedy at law, and whenever it is necessary or proper to have any fact in such a case tried by a jury, it
shall be done in such manner, as the court shall direct.

SE01‘. 7. The said court or any one of the justices thereof may
either in term time or vacation, at any time after the commencement
of such suit, issue an injunction to stay or prevent any nuisance on the
premises in question, and may issue all such other writs and processes, and make all such orders and decrees in the case, according to
the course of proceedings in chancery, as justice and equity may require, and as may be necessary or proper, to carry into effect the

powers hereby granted.
SEC. 8. When an action on the case for a nuisance is pending,

for redeeming them.

SECION 1. After the breach of the condition of a mortgage of
real estate, the mortgagee may recover possession of the mortgaged
premises by action, in the manner hereinafter provided, or he may
make an open and peaceable entry thereon, if not opposed by the
mortgagor or other person claiming the premises ; and such possession,
obtained in either mode, being continued peaceably for three years,

shall forever foreclose the right of redemption.
SE01‘. 2. When an entry, for breach of the condition, is made

without a judgment, a memorandum or certificate thereof shall be
made on the mortgage deed, and signed by the mortgagor or the person claiming under him, and the same shall, within thirty days thereafter, he recorded in the registry of deeds, where the mortgage is
recorded, with a note of reference from each record to the other;

or else, a certiticate of two competent witnesses to prove the entry
shall be made and sworn to before a justice of the peace, and recorded within thirty days after the entry, in the registry of deeds,
where the mortgage is recorded, with notes of reference as before
provided ; and no such entry shall be eifectual, for the purposes mentioned in the preceding section, unless a certificate, or a deposition in
proof thereof, shall be made and recorded in the manner herein provided.
SI-:c'r. 3. The mortgagee, in an action for possession, may declare on his own seizin, as in a writ of entry, without mentioning the

deed of conveyance, or the condition or defeasance thereof, and if it
shall appear to the court, upon the default of the defendant, or upon
demurrer, or verdict, or otherwise, that the plaintiff is entitled to the
possession of the premises, for breach of the condition of ‘the mortgage, the court shall, at the motion of either party, award the conditional judgment hereinafter mentioned, except as is provided in the

following section.
SEC. 4. If the defendant in the action is not the mortgagor nor

an assignee of the mortgagor, and not entitled to hold or claim the
premises under him, such defendant shall not redeem the remises,
nor have a conditional judgment rendered in the manner betidre mentioned, unless with the consent of the plaintiff in the action, but the
suit shall be conducted, in all respects, like a writ of entry ; and in all
cases, when the plaintiff prevails, the judgment may be entered for
possession as at common law, unless one or the other of the parties
shall move for the conditional judgment.

SEC. 5. When the conditional judgment is to be entered, the
court shall inquire and determine how much is due to the plaintiff on
the mortgage, and shall then enter judgment, that if the defendant

shall, within two months after the judgment, pay to the plaintiff the
sum so found due on the mortgage, with interest and the costs of the
suit, the mortgage shall be void, and the defendant shall hold the premises discharged thereof; otherwise, that the plaintiff shall have his
execution for possession of the premises, and for the costs of the
suit.

SE01‘. 6. When the condition of the mortgage is for the doing
of somethin other than the payment of money, the court shall vary
the terms o? the judgment, as the case may require, but shall award
execution as before provided, unless the defendant shall, within two
months after the, judgment, perform what shall be therein prescribed.

SE01‘. 7. An entry for breach of the condition may be made, and
an action for possession may be brought, by any assignee of the mortgagee, whether the assignment be by deed or by 0 eration of law, and
the action shall be conducted in like manner, as i brought by the original mortgagee ; and when brought by an executor or administrator,
it shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in the sixty fifth chapter.
SI-JCT. 8. The action may be brought, in the same manner as a
writ of entry, against whoever is tenant of the freehold, and the mortgagor may, in all cases, be joined as a defendant, whether he then
has any estate in the premises or not ; but he shall not be liable for any
costs, when he has no estate in the premises, and makes no defence
to the suit.

Sr-zcr. 9. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent a mortgagee, or any person claiming under him, from entering on the premises, or recovering possession thereof, before any breach of the condition of the mortgage, when there is no agreement to the contrary ;
but, in such case, if the debt is afterwards paid, or the mortgage redeemed, the amount of the clear rents and profits, from the time of the
entry, shall be accounted for, and deducted from the sum due on the
mortgage.

S1-:c'r. 10. In case of such an entry, before a breach of the condition, the three years limited for the redemption shall not begin to
run, until after the condition is broken, nor until after a notice in writing, given by the mortgagee or the person claiming under him, to the
mortgagor _or the erson claiming under him, that the former will
thenceforward hold) the premises for the breach of the condition, or
for the purpose of foreclosing the mortgage.

SEC. 11. In the case mentioned in the preceding section, the
person, entitled to hold the premises for breach of the condition, may,
instead of such notice in writing, make a new formal entry for the
breach of the condition, or may bring an action therefor, in the manner before provided in this chapter ; and such action, if brought
against the mortgagor, or any person claiming under him, may be maintained, notwithstanding the premises are at that time in the possession
of the plaintiff.

SEC. 12. No such notice of an intention to hold for breach of
the condition, and no such new entry for breach of the condition, as
are mentioned in the two preceding sections, shall be effectual for the
purposes there mentioned, unless a certificate thereof, or a deposition to prove the same, shall be made and recorded in like manner, as

is before provided, in the case of an original entry for breach of the
condition.

SI.=:c'r. 13. When the condition of any mortgage of real estate
has been broken, the mortgagor, or any person lawfully claiming or
holding under him, may redeem the same, in the manner provided in
the following sections, unless the mortgagee, or some person lawfully
holding or claiming under him, has obtained possession of the premises for the breach of the condition, and has continued that possession for three years, as before provided in this chapter.

Saar. 14. The person entitled to redeem the estate shall pay

‘ or tender to the mortgagee, or to the person lawfully claiming or holding under him, the whole sum then due and payable on the mortgage,
and shall perform, or tender performance of, every other condition
contained therein ; and if there has been any suit for recovering the
premises, he shall also pay or tender the costs of such suit, if not before paid.

S1-:c'r. 15. If the mortgagee or any person under him has had possession of the premises, he shall account for the rents and profits thereof, and shall be allowed for all sums expended thereon in reasonable
repairs and improvements, all sums paid for lawful taxes and assessments,
and all other necessary expenses in the care and management of the
premises ; and if on such account there shall be a balance due from
him, that balance shall be considered as so much aid towards the
debt. due on the mortgage, and if there shall be a b ance due to him,
it dshall be added to the debt, and be paid or tendered as before provi ed.

SEC. 16. Such tender’ may be made at any time within the
three years before limited for the redemption, and before as well as
after an entry for breach of the condition ; and if the mortgagee, or
the person claiming or holding under him, shall not accept the same,
and thereupon discharge the mortgage in the manner prescribed by
law, the mortgagor, or the person claiming or holding under him, may
recover the premises by a bill in equity for redemption, to be prosecuted as hereinafter provided.

Saar. 17. Such tender, if not accepted, shall not prevent the
foreclosure of the right of redemption, unless a suit thereon be commenced within one year after the tender is made.

SEC. 18. The person entitledvto redeem, may bring a bill for
redemption without any previous tender, and may in his bill offer to
pay such sum as shall be found due from him, or to perform such
other condition as the case may require ; and such suit may be brought
at any time within the three years limited for the redemption, and
either before or after an entry for breach of the condition.

SEC. 19. If the suit is brought without a previous tender, and
if it shall appear that any thing is due on the mortgage, the plaintiff
shall pay to the defendant his costs of the suit, unless it shall appear
that the defendant has unreasonably refused or neglected, when requested, to render a just and true account of the money due on the
mortgage, and of the rents and profits of the mortgaged premises, and
of the money, if any, paid for taxes and expended in repairs and ‘improvements and other necessary expenses, or that he has otherwise,
by his default, prevented the plaintiff from performing or tendering

performance of the condition, before the commencement of the suit;
and in all other cases of a bill for redemption, the court may, in their
discretion, award costs to either party, as equity shall require.

SEC. 20. When a bill for redemption is founded on a previous
tender, and it shall appear that the tender was insutiicient, the plaintiff shall nevertheless be entitled to a decree for redemption, in the
same manner as if no tender had been set forth in the bill, according
to the provisions of the two preceding sections, provided the suit be
commenced within the three years limited for the redemption.

SEC. 21. The bill for redemption may be brought, eitherin the
court of common pleas, or in the supreme judicial court, held for the
county where the land lies, and if brought in the court of common
pleas, an appeal may be had to the supreme judicial court, as in other civil actions.

Saar. 22. The bill may be inserted in a writ of original summons, or the suit may be commenced by a subpoena, according to the
course of proceedings in chancery, and in either case, the process
shall be served as in other civil actions‘.

SEC. 23. If it shall appear that the plaintiff is entitled to redeem the mortgaged premises, the court shall inquire and determine
what sum is due on the mortgage, or what other act the plaintiff is
bound to perform for the redemption thereof, and shall enter a decree, that upon the payment of such sum, or the performance of such
other thing, within such time as the court shall order, the plainti&'
shall have possession of the premises, to hold discharged of the mort8389- . ..
Snow. 24. The court may at the same time order or decree,
that if the defendant shall refuse or neglect to accept the money, or
other thing, required by the decree to be paid or performed, the money shall be left for his use with the clerk of the court, or that such
other thing shall be done as the case may require ; and the plaintiff,
in all cases, after having performed every thing required of him by
the decree of the court, may have an execution in common form, for
possession of the mortgaged premises.

Sracr. 25. If, upon a bill for redemption, it shall appear that the
defendant has received, from the rents and profits of the estate, or
otherwise, more than is due on the mortgage, the court shall award
judgment and execution against him, in the common form, for such
sum as shall be due to the plaintiff; and if there are several defendants, such judgment and execution may be awarded against them,
either jointly or severally, as the case may require, for the sums received by them or either of them respectively.

SEC. 26. When the money tendered and brought into court,
shall exceed the sum found to be due on the mortgage, and also when
any sum shall beawarded to the plaintiff, on account of the rents and
profits received by the defendant, or for costs of the suit, the court
may order the whole amount, so due to the plaintiff, to be deducted from
the money brought into court, and the same shall be restored to the
plaintiff, and the residue of the money brought into court shall he
paid to the defendant. Srzcr. 27. If a mortgagee, or any person claiming or holding under him, shall receive from the rents and profits of the premises, or

upon a tender made to him, or in any other manner, more than is due
on the mortgage, and if no bill for redemption is brought against him,
the mortgagor or other person entitled to such excess may recover it,
in an action of assumpsit for money had and received to his use.
SEC. 28. If, during the pendency of a bill for redemption, it

i shall appear that any other person is interested therein, the court may

cause him to be made a party to the suit, upon such terms as they
shall think proper, and may order a summons or a subpcena to be issued and served on him, in such manner as they shall direct ; and he
shall thereupon be required and allowed to a pear and answer to the
suit, and shall be considered as a defendant t erein, in like manner as
if he had been originally sued as a defendant.

SEC. 29. In all suits, brought under the provisions of this chapter, either for the redemption of mortgaged premises, or for the purpose of foreclosing the right of redemption, the court shall have power, as to all things not herein provided for, to make such order, judgment or decree, as justice and equity may require, and to issue such
process as may be necessary or proper, according to the course of
proceedings in chancery.

SEC. 30. If any person, entitled to redeem any mortgaged

estate, shall die without having made a tender for that purpose, a

tender may be made, and a bill for redemption commenced and
prosecuted, as well by the executors or administrators, as, by the
eirs or devisees, of the deceased person.

Sear. 3]. If a tender has been made by any such deceased person, in his life time, a bill for redemption, founded thereon, may be
commenced and prosecuted, either by his heirs or devisees, or by his
executors or administrators, in like manner as it might have been by
the party himself; and if the laintiff in any bill in equity shall die
pending the suit, whether it is founded on a previous tender or not,
the suit may be prosecuted to final judgment, by his heirs or devisees,
or his executors or administrators.

SEC. 32. When the mortgagee, or the person, claiming or holding under him, is under guardianship, as an infant or otherwise, the
tender may be made to the guardian, and he may, upon receiving
payment of the sum due on the mortgage, or upon the performance
of such other condition, as the case may require, execute a release
of the mortgage.

SEC. 33. If, after the foreclosure of any mortgage, the person,
entitled to the debt secured by the mortgage, shall recover judgment

V for any part of the debt, on the ground that the value of the mortgaged premises, at the time of the oreclosure, was less than the sum due
thereon, such a recovery shall open the foreclosure, and the mortgagor, or the person claiming or holding under him, may redeem the
premises, notwithstanding the three years limited in that behalf may
ave expired, provided his bill for redemption be brought within one
year after the recovery of such judgment.
S1-‘JCT. 34. The mortgages, mentioned in this chapter, shall inr clude not only those made by a common deed of mortgage, but also

such as are made by a conveyance, with a separate deed of defeasance.
SE01‘. 35. When artv mortgage is made or assigned to the Commonwealth, the treasurer may demand and receive the money due
thereon, and upon payment thereof, he shall make and acknowledge a
discharge of the mortgage.

SEC. 36. If the condition of such mortgage is not duly performed, the treasurer may cause an entry, for the breach of the condition, to be made by himself, or by any person whom he shall appoint for that purpose, in the name and behalf of the Commonwealth,
or he may bring an action, in the name of the Commonwealth, to
recover possession of the mortgaged premises ; and such possession,
obtained either by entry or by action, shall have the same effect towards foreclosing the right of redemption, as is before provided in
the case of such possession by any other mortgagee.

SEC. 37. The mortgagor or his assigns may redeem such mortgaged premises from the Commonwealth, in like manner, and upon
the same terms, as if they were held by any other mortgagee, and
the payment, or performance of the condition for that purpose, shall
be made or tendered to the treasurer, for the use of the Commonwealth.

Snow. 38. If the treasurer, and the person applying to redeem
such mortgage, shall disagree as to the sum due thereon, the person
so applying may bring a bill in equity against the Commonwealth, for’
the redemption thereof.

SEC. 39. The suit shall be brought in the supreme judicial
court for the county of Suffolk, and the process thereon shall be
served on the treasurer, whose duty it shall be to appear and answer
thereto, in behalf of the Commonwealth, and the like proceedings
shall be had thereon, and the like judgment rendered, as are before
provided, in the case _of a bill for redemption, against any other mortgagee ; except, that the treasurer shall accept the payment, if any,
due to the Commonwealth, and upon the receipt thereof, or upon
the performance of such other act, as the court shall order, the treasurer shall discharge the mortgage, in like manner as when the debt
is paid without any suit.

SEC. 40. When the condition of any mortgage of personal
property has been broken, the mortgagor, or any person lawfully
claiming or holding under him, may redeem the same, at any time
within sixty days thereafter, unless the property shall, in the mean
time, have been sold, in pursuance of the contract between the
parties. .

SEC. 41. The person, entitled to redeem the property, shall pay
or tender to the mortgagee, or to the person holding under him, the
sum due on the mortgage, with all reasonable and lawful charges and
expenses, incurred in the care and custody of the property, or otherwise arising from the mortgage thereof; and if the property is not
forthwith restored, the person, entitled to redeem the same, may
recover it in [an] action of replevin, or may recover such damages,
as he may have sustained by the withholding thereof, in any action
adapted to the circumstances of the case.

may be recovered, upon an in ormation filed and prosecuted as provided in this chapter.

SEC. 2. The information shall be liled by the attorney general
or any district attorney, in the supreme judicial court in any county, describing the premises, and setting forth the title and claim of the
Commonwealth thereto ; and a summons shall thereupon issue to the
persons therein named as intruders or trespassers, and shall be made
returnable in the county where the lands lie.

' SE01‘. 3. The service of the summons, and all the other-proceedings in the suit, shall be conducted in the same manner, substantially, as in real actions between private persons, unless where a difterent course is prescribed.

S1-zcr. 4. Costs shall be awarded and taxed, as in other cases, for
the party prevailing, and if the judgment is in favor of the Commonwealth, an execution for the costs shall issue in common form, and if
it is in favor of the defendant, the costs shall be paid out of the treasury, by warrant of the governor and council.

Saar. 5. If the judgment is in favor of the Commonwealth, it
shall not be necessary to take out a writ of possession, or any like process, but the Commonwealth shall be deemed and taken to be actually seized and possessed of the premises, as soon as the judgment is
rendered.

SE01‘. 6. When the title of the Commonwealth is founded on a
forfeiture for the breach of a condition, in any grant or conveyance
made by'the Commonwealth, or by the late province or colony of
Massachusetts Bay, no suit therefor shall be commenced, unless by
an order of the legislature.

SE01‘. 7. If the claim of the Commonwealth is founded on an
escheat, for want of heirs of the last owner of the premises, or on
any other title, except that of the forfeiture mentioned in the preceding section, the attorney general or district attorney may commence
and prosecute a suit therefor, whenever he shall have good reason

to believe that the claim of the Commonwealth can be established
by proof. ~

Snow. 8. In case of any supposed escheat, when no person ap- ;
pears as the heir of the person last seized, and in all cases when there 
is reason to suppose that there is any person claiming any estate or 1
interest in the premises, whose name is unknown, or who is absent
from the state, or cannot be found therein, to be served with process,
the court shall, in addition to any other service, order notice to be
given to all persons interested, to appear and answer to the information, by causing the substance thereof, with the order of the court
thereon, to be published, three weeks successively, in such newspaper

premises, although the Commonwealth should fail to establish their
claim thereto.

SE01‘. 10. When there are several defendants, the court may:
award costs for or against any one of them, as the justice of the case ,
may require, in like manner as if he had been the only defendant in

require or permit him to be examined anew, in the suit on the scire
facias, and in either case, he shall be permitted to plead and prove
any matter, that may be necessary or proper, for his defence in the
suit on the scire facias ; and upon the whole matter appearing upon

which he is liable ; and this shall be deemed a suliicient demand, for
all the purposes expressed in the three preceding sections.

acquit and discharge him from all demands by the principal defendant, or his executors or administrators, for all goods, effects and
credits, paid, delivered or accounted for by the trustee, by force of

Sac/r. 50. If such person shall be adjudged a trustee, his said
costs and charges shall be deducted and retained, out of the goods,
effects and credits in his hands, and he shall be chargeable for the
balance only, to be paid on the execution.

St~:c'r. 51. If such person shall be discharged as a trustee,
whether by reason of his having no goods, effects or credits in his
hands, or because the plaintiff shall not recover judgment against the
principal defendant, or for any other cause, his said costs and charges
shall be paid by the plaintiff, and the trustee shall have judgment and
execution therefor accordingly. '

.,r;c'r. 52. If the person, summoned as a trustee, is out of the
state at the time of the service of the original writ on him, and if he

shall appear as before provided, at the first term after his return, he

shall be allowed for his said costs and charges, in the same manner

as if he had appeared at the term when the action was entered.
SEC. 53. If the person so summoned does not dwell in the

' county in which the writ is returnable, he shall in all cases be allowed

his said costs and charges, which shall be retained or recovered as
before provided, whether he appears at the first or at any other term,
and whether in the original suit, or upon a scire facias against him.

Sncr. 54. If any person, who is summoned as a trustee, and

provided, he shall be liable for all costs for the plaintiff ’s travel and
attendance, until the trustee shall appear as aforesaid, provided the
plaintiff recovers judgment in the suit, and that his said costs are not
otherwise recovered and received by him.

SEC. 55. If the person, so liable for costs, shall not voluntarily
pay the amount thereof, when demanded by the‘ omcer who serves
the execution, the ollicer shall state that fact in his return on the execution, and if it appears by the same return, that the said costs have
not been paid by any other person, or in any other manner, the court

trustee, for the costs due from him.

SEc'r. 56. If there are several persons summoned as trustees,

others shall be bound to contribute equally, to indemnify him for the
excess.

facias, to be paid out of his own goods and estate, whether he is

finally adjudged to be a trustee or not, except as hereinafter pro-_

SEC. 58. If it shall appear that the person so defaulted had in
his hands goods, effects or credits, liable to the attachment, and that

issued on the original judgment, he shall not be liable for any costs in
the suit on the scire facias, nor shall he be entitled to recover any
costs.

SEC. 59. If the person so defaulted shall have been prevented
from appearing in the original suit, by his absence from the state, or
for any other reason that the court shall deem sufficient, he shall not
be liable for any costs in the suit on the scire facias, but the court
may, if it shall appear to them reasonable, allow him his costs and
charges for travel and attendance, and for his counsel fees and other
necessary expenses, to be retained or recovered, in like manner as if
he had appeared in the original suit.

SEC. 60. If any person, who is summoned as a trustee, shall

suit, one execution against him shall be issued for both sums.

scire facias, the plaintiff may have one writ against them all jointly,

more of them, but°if he shall, without any reason which the court
shall deem sufficient, sue out two or more writs, when he might have

joined all the trustees in one writ, he shall recover no more costs in

the whole than if he had sued out only one writ, and the court may
apportion the costs equally and proportionally, among all the trustees
who are liable therefor.

original suit, or on a writ of scire facias, the execution shall not be

Sncr. 75. VVhen it shall become necessary to sue out a writ of
scire facias against any person, who has been summoned as a trustee,

plaintiff in the foreign attachment, or to his executors or administrators, the full amount due on the judgment recovered therein, with interest therefor, to be recovered in a special action on the case, and
he shall, moreover, on conviction thereof upon indictment, be adjudged guilty of perjury.

expense of keeping the beasts, and also t e fees due to the field
driver, which latter, when received, he shall pav to the field driver

SE01‘. 4. When any person is injured in his land, by sheep,
swine, horses, asses, mules, goats, or neat cattle, he may recover his
damages in an action of trespass against the owner of the beasts, or
by distraining the beasts doing the damage, and proceeding therewith
as herein after directed ; provided, that if the beasts shall have been
lawfully on the adjoining lands, and shall have escaped therefrom, in
consequence of the neglect of the person, who has suffered the damage, to maintain his part of the division fence, the owner of the
beasts shall not be liable for such damage.

SEC. 5. The beasts so distrained for doing damage shall be impounded, either in the town pound, or in some suitable place, under
the immediate care and inspection of the person who distrained them,
and he shall furnish them with suitable food and water, so long as

SE01‘. 6. f the beasts are impounded, in the town pound, the

any other place, he shall give a like memorandum to the owner of the
beasts, if demanded by him.

SE01‘. 8. When beasts are impounded, the person impoundin'g

taken, a written notice, containing a description of the beasts, and a
statement of the time, place and cause of impounding them ; and in
such case, if the value of the beasts shall exceed thirty dollars, and
if no person shall appear to claim them, within seven days after the
day of impounding, a like notice shall be published, three weeks

so determined by them shall be received, instead of the sum demanded by the person who impounded the beasts, and they shall thereupon
be delivered to the owner or keeper thereof.

which they are impounded and detained, including a reasonable compensation for their own services.

beasts distrained or impounded, shall not be allowed to allege or give
in evidence the insufiiciency of the fences, or any other fact or circumstance, to show that the distress or impounding was illegal; but

he is entitled to avail himself, he may have the advantage thereof, in
an action of replevin, to he brought as provided in the following
SECions.

REPLEVIN OI-‘ CATTLE DISTRAINED.

SEC. 17. Any person, whose beasts are distrained or impounded, in order to recover any penalty or forfeiture, supposed to have
been incurred by their going at large, or to obtain satisfaction for any
damages, alleged to have been done by them, may maintain a writ of
replevin therefor, to be sued out, and prosecuted before any justice

of the peace for the county, in the same form, substantially, that has
been heretofore established and used in such cases.

SEC. 18. The writ shall be sued out, served and returned, and
the cause shall be heard and determined, in like manner as is provided in the case of other civil actions before a justice of the peace,
in all particulars in which a different course is not prescribed.

SEC. 19. The writ shall not be served, unless the plaintiff, or ‘V
someone in his behalf, shall execute and deliver to the officer abond ‘

to the defendant, with sufficient sureties, to be approved by the officer, in a penalty double the value of the property to be replevied,
with condition to prosecute the replevin to final judgment, and to pay
such damages and costs, as the defendant shall recover against him,
and also to return the said property, in case such shall be the final
judgment.

SEC. 20. The writ shall require that such bond shall be given l
in double the value of the property to be replevied, but shall not
express the sum or amount, for which it shall be given; and the;

value of the property shall be ascertained by three disinterested and
discreet persons, to be appointed and sworn by the ofiicer, when the
parties shall not agree as to the value, and the penalty of the bond
shall be equal to double the value ascertained by the persons so appointed, or by any two of them.

SEC. 21. The officer shall return with the writ the bond that;
he shall take, to be left with the justice, for the use of the defendant, 1

and he shall also include in his return, indorsed on the writ, a certificate of the appointment of the said three appraisers, and of the appraisal, and of the expenses thereof.

SEC. 22. If it shall appear, upon the nonsuit of the plaintiff, or ~

upon a trial or otherwise, that the beasts were lawfully taken or distrained, the defendant shall have judgment for such sum, as shall be
found to be due from the plaintiff, for the penalty or forfeiture, or for
the damages, for which the beasts were impounded, together with all
the legal fees, costs, charges, and expenses, incurred by reason of
the distress, and also the costs of the action of replevin ; or instead
of such judgment, the justice may in his discretion enter judgment for
a return of the beasts to the defendant, to be held by him, irrepleviable by the plaintiff, and for the defendant’s damages for the taking
thereof by the replevin, and for his costs of the suit.

SEC. 23. \Vhen the beasts are returned to the defendant, pur- j
suant to such judgment, they shall be held and disposed of, in like p

manner as if they had not been replevied.

or upon a trial or otherwise, that the beasts were taken or distrained,
without any sufficient or justifiable cause, the plaintiff shall have judgment for his damages caused by the unjust taking and detaining of the
beasts, and for his costs of the suit.

S207. 2.5. Either party may appeal from the final judgment of
the justice, in like manner as in other civil actions tried before a
justice of the peace.

penalty, forfeiture or damages, exceeds the sum of twenty dollars, or
that the property of the beasts is in question, and that their value exceeds twenty dollars, or that the title to real estate is concerned or
brought in question, the case shall, at the request of either party, be
transferred to the court of common pleas, and be there disposed of,
in like manner as is provided in the eighty fifth chapter, with respect
to common civil actions, brought before a justice of the peace, in
which the title to real estate is concerned or brought in question.

or OTHER REPLEVIN or GOODS.

goods of that value, which are attached on mesne process or taken in
execution, are claimed by any person other than the defendant in the
suit, in which they are so taken or attached, such owner or other
person may cause them to be replevied, by a writ to be sued out and

prosecuted, as hereinafter provided.

1 SI-:c'r. 28. The writ shall be sued out of, and returnable to, the

' court of common pleas for the county, in which the goods are de' tained ; it shall be in the same form, substantially, that has been heretofore established and used, and shall be sued out, served and returned, like other writs in civil actions, in all particulars, in which a
different course is not prescribed, and the general issue shall be
joined on the plea of not guilty.

r Seer. 29. The officer, before serving the writ, shall take from
the plaintiff or from some one in his behalf, a bond to the defendant,
with sufiicient sureties, in double the value of the goods to be replevied, with a condition like that of the bond before prescribed to

e taken upon a writ of replevin, brought before a justice of the peace;
and the oflicer shall proceed, with regard to the appraisal of the goods,
and the return of the writ, in the manner provided with respect to
such action before a justice, except that the bond shall be left with the
clerk of the court, for the use of the defendant.

SEC. 30. If it shall appear, upon the nonsuit of the plaintiff,
or upon a trial or otherwise, that the defendant is entitled to a return
of the goods, he shall have judgment therefor accordingly, with damages for the taking thereof by the replevin, and his costs of suit.

S1~:c'r. 31. If the goods, when replevied, were taken in execution, or if they were then attached, and judgment be afterwards rendered for the attaching creditor, and if in either case the service of
the execution be delayed, by means of the replevin, the damages to
be assessed for the defendant, in case of a judgment for a return, shall
be not less than at the rate of twelve per cent. by the year, on the
value of the goods, for so long as the service of the execution shall
be so delayed.

SEC. 32. All sums, recovered in an action of replevin by any
officer, for or on account of any goods attached or taken in execution
by him, or recovered in an action upon the bond given upon the
replevin of such goods, shall be applied and disposed of, as far as

First, to pay the lawful fees and charges of the oflicer, and the

reasonable expenses of the action of replevin, and the action on the
bond, so far as they are not reimbursed by the costs that mav be recovered :

Secondly, to pay to the creditor, at whose suit the goods were
attached or taken in execution, the sum, if any, recovered by him in
that suit, or as much thereof as shall remain unpaid, with interest
therefor, at the rate of twelve per cent. by the year, for such time, if
any, as the money shall have been withheld from the creditor, or the
service of his execution delayed, by reason of the replevin : and

Thirdly, if the attaching creditor, in such case, shall not recover
judgment in the suit in which the attachment was made, or if any balance shall remain of the moneys so recovered by the oliicer, after paying what is due to the creditor, as before provided, such balance, or
the whole amount, as the case may be, shall be applied and disposed
of, in the same manner as would and ought to have been done with
the surplus, if any, of the proceeds of sale, in case the same goods
had been sold on execution.

SI-JCT. 33. All sums, received by such creditor from the proceeds
of the sale of any goods, that had been attached or taken in execution,
and which are afterwards returned, and all sums, received for the value
of any such goods, that are not returned, and also all sums recovered
from the ofiicer, for the insufficiency of the sureties in the bond, shall
be applied towards the discharge of the judgment recovered by the
creditor; and all sums, received as interest or damages for the delay
of his execution, shall be retained to his own use, and shall not go in
discharge of the °udgment. \

the suit.

SEC. 35. The damages, in all cases of replevin before a justice
of the peace, whether for the plaintiff or for the defendant, shall be
assessed by the justice, or if it is heard and determined in the court
of common pleas, or in the supreme judicial court, the damages shall
be assessed by the jury, by which the cause is tried, if there is any
trial by jury ; otherwise they shall be assessed upon an inquiry by the
court, or by a jury empannelled for that purpose, in like manner as
damages are assessed in other civil actions.

and for thirty days thereafter, in order to their being taken in execution ; and if such final judgment shall be rendered, before the return of
the goods, or if the goods when replevied were seized and held on
execution, they shall be held, subject to the same attachment or seizure, for thirty days after the return, in order that the execution may
be served thereon, or the service thereof completed, in like manner
as it might have been, if the goods had not been replevied.

SEC. 37. If the officer, to whom the writ of return is committed, shall not be able to find the beasts or other goods, that were replevied, so as to deliver them to the defendant, he shall make a return of that fact upon the writ of return, and the defendant shall

to take the beasts or goods of the laintiff and deliver them to the defendant, to be held and disposed oi? according to law.

Sr-:01‘. 38. The writ of return, in all actions of replevin, shall be
substantially in the same form, that has been heretofore established
and used in the like case, and the writ of reprisal shall be substantially in the same form with the writ heretofore called a writ of withernam.
Sr-:c'r. 39. The foregoing provisions shall not preclude the de' fendant from resorting to his remedy on the replevin bond, or to his

remedy against the oflicer for the insufiiciency of the sureties in the
bond, to recover the value of the goods, together with the loss or
damage caused by the replevin thereof, notwithstanding he may have
endeavored to recover the same, by the writs of return and of reprtsal,
as before provided.

SEC. 40. No action shall be maintained against any person, as
surety in a replevin bond, unless the writ be served on him within

' one year after the final judgment in the action of replevin; or if the

action shall not be entered by the plaintiff, and the defendant shall
not obtain judgment upon a complaint, such writ against the surety
may be served on him, within one year after the end of the term at
which the action of replevin ought to have been entered and not afterwards.

the regulations, hereinafter expressed.

Sacr. 2. No such dam shall be erected, to the injury of any mill
lawfully existing, either above or below it, on the same stream, nor
to the injury of any mill site on the same stream, on which a mill or
mill dam shall have been lawfully erected and used, unless the right
to maintain a mill, on such last mentioned site, shall have been lost or
defeated, by abandonment or otherwise; nor shall any mill or dam
be placed on the land of any person, without such grant, conveyance
or authority from the owner, as would be necessary by the common
law, if no provision relating to mills had been made by statute.

Sscr. 3. The height, to which the water may be raised, and the
length of time, or period, for which it may be kept up in each year,
shall be liable to be restricted and regulated by the verdict of a jury,

as hereinafter provided.
SE01‘. 4. Any person, whose land is overflowed, or otherwise

injured by such dam, may obtain compensation therefor, upon his
complaint before the court of common pleas for the county where the
land or any part thereof lies, provided, that no compensation shall be
awarded for any damage, sustained more than three years before the
institution of the complaint.

SEC. 5. The complaint shall contain such a description of the
land, alleged to be flowed or injured, and such a statement of the
damage, that the record of the case shall show, with sutiicient certainty, the matter that shall have been heard and determined therein.

SEC. 6. The complaint may be filed in the court in term time,
or in the clerk’s office in vacation, and in either case, notice thereof
shall be given to the owner or occupant of the mill, by delivering to
him, or by leaving at his dwelling house, an attested copy of the said
complaint, or if he is not found within the state, and has no dwelling
house therein, then by leaving such copy at the mill in question ; or
the complainant may, fourteen days at least before the sitting of the
court, at which his complaint may be brought, cause the owner or
occupant of such mill or dam to be served with an attested copy of
the complaint, by delivering or leaving such copy, in like manner as
when the complaint is filed as aforesaid.

SEC. 7. The notice shall be given fourteen days at least before
the term at which the complaint is to be heard, and it shall be served by any otiicer, who is authorized to serve any other civil process
between the same parties.

SEC. 8. The respondent may plead in bar of the complaint,
that the complainant has no estate or interest in the land, alleged to
be Bowed or injured, or that the respondent has a right to maintain his
dam, for an agreed price, or without any compensation, or any other
matter, which may show that the complainant cannot maintain the suit ;
but he shall not plead in bar of the complaint, that the land therein
described is not injured by such dam.

Snow. 9. If any plea is filed by the respondent, the replication
and other pleadings, and the trial of the issue, whether of law or of
fact, shall be conducted in like manner as in actions at the common
law.

the respondent, or if, in any stage of the proceedings, the complainant
shall become nonsuit, or shall discontinue his suit, the respondent
shall be entitled to his costs, to be taxed as in common civil actions.

SEC. 11. If the issue is decided in favor of the complainant, or
‘if the owner or occupant of the mill or dam shall, after due notice,
neglect to appear, or shall be defaulted, or if there be no plea in bar,
and no other legal objection to the proceeding, the court shall, without any further pleadings in the case, issue a warrant for a jury to
hear and determine the matter of the complaint.

SEC. 12. Either party may appeal to the supreme judicial court,
from the judgment of the court of common pleas, upon any such plea
in bar, and the cause shall be there heard and determined, as it ought
to have been in the court of common pleas ; except, that if the judgment of the supreme judicial court, in such case, shall be in favor of
the complainant, the case shall be remitted to the court of common
pleas, who shall proceed therein in like manner as if such judgment
had been rendered in that court.

Snow. 13. The warrant shall be directed and served, and the

SEC. 15. The jury, in estimating the damage to the land of the

' complainant, shall take into consideration any damage, occasioned to
his other land, by the dam, as well as the damage occasioned to the

benefit, if any, occasioned by such dam to the complainant, in relation
to his said lands.

SEc'r. 16. If the jury shall find that the complainant is not entitled to recover any damages, they shall return their verdict accordingly, and if It is allowed and recorded by the court, judgment shall

Sncr. 20. The complainant in such case, at any time within
three months after the verdict is allowed and recorded, may elect to
take the sum in gross, so awarded by the jury, for the right to maintain and use the dam forever, instead of receiving the annual compensation therefor, and if he shall make such election, he shall, within the
said three months, cause the same to be entered on the record of the
case in the clerk’s ofline.

complaint, as hereinafter provided.

SEC. 23. The person who shall be entitled to receive the said
annual com ensation, or gross damages, shall havea lien therefor from
the time ofp the institution of the original complaint, on the mill and

or occupy the mill when the action is brought, and shall therein recover the whole sum due and unpaid for the three years then last
past, whoever may have owned or occupied the mill during that time,

month, offer in writing, to the owner of the land that is injured, any
increase of the annual compensation to be thereafter paid for maintaining and using the dam ; and if the owner of the land shall not agree

dam ; and if the owner of the mill or dam shall not agree to pay such
reduced compensation, but shall bring a new complaint, in order to
obtain a diminution thereof, he shall not be entitled to costs upon his
complaint, but shall pay costs to the adverse party, unless the annual
compensation shall be reduced, by the verdict, to a sum less than that

said owners, unless it be made with their consent.

Sacr. 39. If the offer so made by either party shall be agreed to

same, with his costs up to that time, but shall proceed in the suit, to
recover greater damages or compensation than is so offered, he shall
be entitled to his costs up to the time of the tender, and the respondent shall be entitled to recover his costs afterwards, unless the complainant shall recover greater damages or greater annual compensation
than was so offered.

in part, and the proprietors shall not all agree to join in repairing or
rebuilding the same, the greater part in interest of the proprietors may
cause the work to be done at the expense of the whole, in proportion
to their respective interests.

stipulated for the whole, and the court shall adjust his claim accord- '

or more successive orders of distribution, as the circumstances may
require

after making all the payments before mentioned, it shall be forthwith
paid over to the owner of the land, but such surplus, before it is so

manner as if it proceeded from a sale made by the otiicer on an execuuon.

SEC. 21. If the land, to which any such contract relates, shall
be under attachment at the time of recording the contract, the attaching creditor shall be preferred, to the extent of the value of the land
and buildings, as they may be when the contract shall be recorded,
and the court shall ascertain, by a jury or otherwise, as the case may
require, what proportion of the proceeds of the sale shall be held subject to the attachment, as derived from the value of the premises,
when the contract was recorded.

judgment in his suit, he shall be entitled to receive on his execution
the said proportion of the proceeds, that are held subject to his attachment, or as much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy his execution, and the residue, if any, of the proceeds of the sale, shall be
applied in the same manner as if there had been no such attachment.

SEC. 23. If the land, to which the contract relates, shall be at- f
tached after the recording of the contract, the proceeds shall be ap- ‘

plied, after discharging all prior liens and claims, to satisfy the execution of such attaching creditor, in like manner as is provided in the
ninety seventh chapter, in the case of two or more successive attachments, or seizures in execution, of a right of redemption, or of a
share in any incorporated company.

SEC. 24. If an attachment is made after the recording of such
a contract, and if after the attachment another like contract should be
recorded, the creditor in the latter contract shall be entitled to be
paid only out of the residue of the proceeds, if any, remaining after
satisfying the attaching creditor, and also paying all that is due on the
contracts that were recorded before the attachment.

SEC. 25. When there are several attaching creditors, they shall,
as between themselves, be entitled to be paid according to the order
of their respective attachments, but when several creditors, who are
entitled to the lien provided for in this chapter, have all equal rights
as between themselves, and the fund shall be insuflicient to pay the
whole, they shall share it equally, in proportion to their respective
debts.

SEC. 26. If the person, who procures the work to be done,
has an estate for life only, or any other estate less than a fee simple,
in the land on which the work is to be done, or if the land, at the
time of recording the contract, is mortgaged, or under any other incumbrance, the person who procures the work to be done shall nevertheless be considered as the owner, for the purposes of this chapter,
to the extent of his right and interest in the land, and the lien before
provided for shall bind his whole estate and interest therein, in like
manner as a mortgage would have done, and the creditor may cause
the right of redemption, or whatever other right or estate the owner
had in the land, to be sold and applied to the discharge of his debt,
according to the provisions of this chapter.

SEC. 27. If the person indebted in any such contract shall die,

. or shall convey away his estate, before the commencement of a suit

on the contract, the suit may be commenced and prosecuted against
his heirs, or whoever shall hold the estate, which he had in the premises, at the time of making the contract ; or if a suit is commenced
in his life time, it may be prosecuted against his heirs or assigns, in
like manner as if the estate had been mortgaged to secure the debt.

SEC. 28. If the creditor in such contract shall die, before the
commencement of a suit thereon, the suit may be commenced and
prosecuted by his executors or administrators, or if commenced in
his life time, it may be prosecuted by them, as it might have been by
the deceased, if living.

SEC. 29. Any party interested in a suit brought under this chapter may appeal to the supreme judicial court, from the final decree
or judgment of the court of common pleas, and the appeal shallobe
conducted and prosecuted, in the same manner, substantially, as is
prescribed in relation to common civil actions, and the cause shall be
thereupon heard and determined in the supreme judicial court, according to the provisions of this chapter.

SEC. 30. If it appear, in any stage of the proceedings under this chapter, that the suit was commenced by the petitioning
creditor before the expiration of the sixty days, or after the expiration of six months, in that behalf before limited, or if the petitioning
creditor should become nonsuit, or should from any cause fail to establish his claim, the suit may nevertheless be prosecuted by any
other creditor having such alien, in the same manner as if it had
been originally commenced by the latter creditor ; provided, the circumstances of the case are such, that he might then, or at any time
after the commencement of the original suit, have commenced a like

suit on his own claim.

SEC. 31. If the suit is commenced by the petitioning creditor,
before the expiration of the sixty days, in that behalf limited, his
claim may nevertheless be allowed, if he is otherwise entitled thereto,
and if the suit is carried on by any other creditor, as provided in the
preceding section, but he shall not in such case be entitled to any
costs, and he may be required to pay the costs, that shall be incurred
by the debtor, or any part thereof, as the court shall think reasonable.

SEC. 32. The costs in all other respects shall be subject to the
discretion of the court, and shall be paid out of the proceeds of the
sale, or by any of the parties in the suit, as justice and equity may require.

SEC. 33. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed
to prevent any creditor in such contract from maintaining an action
thereon at the common law, in like manner as if he had no such lien
for the security of his debt.

S1-:c'r. 34. The register of deeds shall receive and record all
contracts, of the kind mentioned in this chapter, that shall be deliverel to him for that purpose, and he shall be entitled to the same fees

SEC. 2. The recognizance may be taken before the court of
common pleas in any county, in term time, or before the clerk of
said court, in vacation, and shall be substantially as follows :

clerk of the court of common pleas for the county of

SE01‘. 3. The clause, as to the payment of interest, may be altered or wholly omitted, according to the agreement of the parties, but
interest shall always be allowed for the delay, if any, after the time of
payment, unless the recognizance contains an express agreement to
the contrary.

SEC. 4. The recognizance shall be attested by the clerk,
whether taken in term time or vacation, and shall he recorded at length
by him, among the records of the court, and the original shall then
be delivered to the conusee.

SEC. 5. No such recognizance shall be taken, unless the judge
or the clerk who takes it shall know, or have satisfactory evidence,
that the person, who offers to enter into the recognizance, is the individual whom he represents himself to be, and who is described as
the conusor.

SEC. 6. If the debt shall not be paid, at the time appointed in
the recognizance for the payment thereof, the conusee shall be entitled
to an execution for the sum due thereon, to be sued outof the clerk’s
office in which the recognizance is recorded, and to be directed, served and returned, in like manner as an execution issued upon a judgment of the same court.

SEC. 7. Before the issuing of such execution, the original recognizance shall be produced and delivered to the clerk, and shall be
filed and preserved by him, in like manner as is done with bonds, or
other evidences of debt, upon which judgment is rendered, and the
clerk shall compute the amount due on the recognizance, deducting
the payments, if any, that shall have been made and indorsed thereon,
and shall issue execution for the sum then due.

SE01‘. 8. The execution shall be in the usual form of an execution on a judgment for debt, except that instead of reciting a judgment, it shall recite the recognizance, and state the amount then due
thereon ; and it may be issued by the clerk, without any special order
of the court. '

Sr:c'r. 9. A recognizance for debt may be taken before any justice of the peace in his county, in any case where it might be taken
before the clerk of the court, and the form shall be the same, excepting the description of the officer before whom it is taken ; and the
justice shall record all recognizances by him taken, in a book kept for
that purpose, and shall, in each case, deliver the original to the conusee, as before required of the clerk of the court.

Sncr. 10. The justice, before whom a recognizance is taken,
shall have the same power to issue execution thereon, as is given in
this chapter to the clerk of the court, and such execution shall have
the same effect as an execution issued by the clerk, excepting that it
shall not be issued against the lands, but only against the money,
goods and chattels of the conusor, and against his body, like an execution issued upon a judgment recovered before a justice of the
peace.

S1.-:c'r. 11. When a recognizance is taken before a justice of the
peace, if the conusee shall desire to have an execution thereon against
the lands of the conusor, as well as against his money, goods and
body, he may, at any time within ninety days after the recognizance
was taken, deliver it to the clerk of the court for the county, who
shall record the same, in like manner as if it had been taken before
himself, and shall issue execution thereon, in like form, ‘and the execution shall have the same force and effect, and shall be directed,
served and returned, in like manner as if the recognizance had been
taken before the clerk.

SEC. 12. All executions, issued on recognizances by the clerk
of the court, or a justice of _the peace, may be executed and shall be
obeyed, in every county to which they are directed, and shall be
made returnable in sixty days from the date thereof.

SEC. 13. If the conusee shall die before the debt is fully paid,
his executor or administrator may sue out execution, in the same
manner as the conusee might have done, upon exhibiting to the clerk
or justice his letters testanleutary or of administration, and without
suing out a scire facias for that purpose, and the form of the execution
shall be altered accordingly.

SEC. 14. If the conusor shall die before the debt is fully paid,
no execution therefor shall be issued as of course, but the estate of the
ronusor in the hands of his executors or administrators, and his heirs
or devisees, shall be liable for the debt, in like manner as if judgment
therefor had been recovered against him in his life time ; and the conusee, or his executors or administrators, may have a scire facias, or
an action of debt, to recover the same, against the executors, administrators, heirs or devisees of the conusor, in like manner as they
might have had upon such a judgment.

SEC. 15. No original execution shall be issued as of course,
upon such a recognizance, after the expiration of three years from
the time therein set for payment of the debt, unless some payment on
account thereof shall have been made and indorsed on the recognizance, anu If there has been any such payment, no such execution
shall issue after the expiration of three years from the time of the last
payment so indorsed ; but the conusee in such case, or his executors
or administrators, may have a scire facias, or an action of debt, on the

recognizance, against the party liable thereon, in like manner and with
the same effect, as they might have had upon a judgment recovered
against the conusor.

Sister. 16. If any execution, issued for the debt secured by such
recognizance, shall be returned unsatisfied, the creditor shall be entitled to an alias, and other successive executions, in like manner as is
or may be allowed with regard to executions on a judgment in civil
actions.

SEC. 17. If there are several conusors, or several conusees,
and one or more of them shall die, before the debt is fully satisfied,
the right and interest of the surviving conusees, and the obligation of

suit, the court shall decree a forfeiture and sale of the goods, and a

police court, and the suit shall be there heard and determined, and

‘value thereof, if they should be decreed forfeited, and to abide by
and perform the final order, decree, or judgment of the court relating
thereto.
