COURTS or CIVIL JUDIOATURE NOT ESTABLISHED
BY ROYAL CHARTER.

WHEREAS it is expedient to simplify the Procedure of the
Courts of Civil Judicature not established by Royal Charter,
It is enacted as follows :—

CHAPTER I.

OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE CIVIL COURTS.

1. The Civil Courts shall take cognizance of all suits of a
Civil nature, with the exception of suits of which their cognizance is barred by any Act of Parliament, or by any Regulation of the Codes of Bengal, Madras and Bombay respectively,
or by any Act of the Governor General of India in Council.

2. The Civil Courts shall not take cognizance of any suit
brought on a cause of action which shall have been heard and

determined by a Court of competent jurisdiction in a former
suit between the same parties or between parties under whom
they claim.

3. The judgments of the Civil Courts shall not be subject
to revision, otherwise than by those Courts under the rules
contained in this Act applicable to reviews of judgment, and
by the constituted Courts of Appellate Jurisdiction.

4. No person whatever shall, by reason of place of birth, or
by reason of descent, be in any Civil proceeding whatever
excepted from the jurisdiction of any of the Civil Courts.

5. Subject to such pecuniary or other limitations as are or
shall be prescribed by any law for the time being in force, the
Civil Courts of each grade shall receive, try, and determine
all suits hereby declared to be cognizable by those Courts, if
in the case of suits for land or other immoveable property
such land or property shall be situate within the limits to
which their respective jurisdictions may extend, and in all
other cases if the cause of action shall have arisen, or the
defendant at the time of commencement of the suit shall
dwell, or personally work for gain, within such limits.

6. Every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest
grade competent to try it. But it shall be lawful for the
District Court to withdraw any suit instituted in any Court
subordinate to such District Court, and to try such suit itself,
or to refer it for trial to any other Court subordinate to its
authority and competent in respect of the value of the suit to
try the same, whenever it may see sullicient cause ‘for so
doing. In like manner the ’ Sudder Court may order that the
cognizance of any suit or appeal which may be instituted in
any Court subordinate to such Sudder Court’ shall be transferred to any other Court subordinate to its authority and
competent in respect of the value of the suit or appeal to try
the same. 1 V

7. Every suit shall include the whole of the claim arising
out of the cause of action, but a plaintih‘ may relinquish any
portion of his claim in order to bring the suit within the
jurisdiction of any Court. If a plaintiff relinquish or omit to

sue for any portion of his claim, a suit for the portion so relinquished or omitted, shall not afterwards be entertained.

8. Causes of action by and against the same parties, and
cognizable by the same Court, may be joined in the same suit,
provided the entire claim- in respect of the amount or value

of the property in suit do not exceed the jurisdiction of such
Court.

9. If two or more causes of action be joined in one suit,
and the Court shall be of opinion that they cannot conveniently be tried together, the Court may order separate
trials of such causes of action to be held.

10. A claim for the recovery of land and a claim for the
mesne profits of such land shall be deemed to be distinct
causes of action within the meaning of the two last preceding
Sections.

11. If the suit be for land or other immoveable property
situate within the limits of a digle District, but within the
jurisdiction of diferent Courts, the suit may be brought in the
Court within the jurisdiction of which any portion of such
land or other immoveable property is situate, provided the
entire claim in respect of the value of the property in suit be
cognizable by such Court; but in such case the Court in
which the suit is brought shall apply to the District Court for
authority to proceed with the same.

12. In like manner, if the property be situate within the
limits of different Districts, the suit may be brought in any
Court, otherwise competent to try it, within the jurisdiction of
which any portion of the land or other immoveable property
in suit is situate, but in such case the Court in which the suit
is brought shall apply to the Sudder Court for authority to
proceed with the same; if the suit is brought in any Court
subordinate to a District Court, the application shall be submitted through the District Court to which such Court is
subordinate.

13. If the Districts within the limits of which the property
is situate, are subject to diiferent Sudder Courts, the application shall be submitted to the Sudder Court to which the
District, in which the suit is brought, is subject; and the
Sudder Court to which such application is made, may, with
the concurrence of the Sudder Court to which the other
District is subject, give authority to proceed with the same.

14. If, in a suit for land situate on the borders of the
Court's local jurisdiction,'the defendant object to the hearing
of the suit on the ground that the land is not included within
the local jurisdiction of the Court, the Court shall have power
to determine the point; and if the Court shall find that the
land is included within its local jurisdiction, it shall proceed
to try the suit. Provided that, if it be shown that the land in
dispute has been adjudged by competent authority to belong
to an estate, village, or other known division of land situate
within the local jurisdiction of another Court, the Court in
which the suit is brought shall reject the plaint, or return it
to the plaintiif in order to its being presented in the proper
Court.

15. No suit shall be open to objection on the ground that

a merely declaratory decree or order is sought thereby, and it
shall be lawful for the Civil Courts to make binding declarations of right without granting consequential relief.

upon such oEicer in the manner hereinbefore provided.

69. If the oilicer on receiving the summons shall consider
it proper to make a reference to Government before answering to the plaint, he may move the Court to grant such extension of the time fixed in the summons as may be necessary
to enable him to make such reference and to receive orders
thereon through the proper channels; and the Court upon
such motion may extend the time for so long as shall appear
to it to be requisite.

the Court that he cannot absent himself from his duty without
injury to the public service, the Court shall exempt him from
such appearance, but he shall be liable to be examined in any
way in which an absent witness may be examined.

PARTIES TO A SUIT.

73. If it appear to the Court, at any hearing of a suit, that

all the persons who may be entitled to, or who claim some ‘

share or interest in the subject matter of the suit, and who
may be likely to be a&'ected by the result, have not been
made parties to the suit, the Court may adjourn the hearing
of the suit to a future day to be fixed by the Court, and direct
that such persons shall be made either plaintifs or defendants
in the suit as the case may be. In such case the Court shall
issue a notice to such persons in the manner provided in this
Act for the service of a summons on a defendant.

OF ARREST BEFORE JUDGMENT.

74. If in any suit, not being a suit for land or other immoveable property, the defendant, with intent to avoid or delay
the plaintiif, or to obstruct or delay the execution°of any decree

‘ that may be passedvagainst him, is about to leave the jurisdiction of the Court, or has disposed of or removed from the jurisdiction of the Court his property or any part thereof, the
plainti&' may, either at the institution of the suit, or at any
time thereafter until final judgment, make an application to
the Court that security be taken for the appearance of the
defendant to answer any judgment that may be passed against
him in the suit. , ‘ _,.

75. If the Court, after examining the applicant and making
such further investigation as it may consider necessary, shall
be of opinion that there is probable cause for believing that
the defendant is about to leave its jurisdiction with the intent
of avoiding or delaying the plaintiff, or that he has disposed
of or removed from the jurisdiction of the Court his property
or any part thereof with the intent to obstruct or delay the
execution of any decree, it shall be lawful for the Court to

issue a warrant to the proper ohicer, enjoining him to bring
the defendant before the Court, that he may show cause why
he should not give good and suilicient bail for his appearance.

76. If the defendant fail to show such cause, the Court
shall order hin1 to give bail for his appearance at any time
when called upon while the suit is pending, and until execution or satisfaction of any decree that may be passed 
him in the suit; and the surety or sureties shall undertake, in
default of such appearance, to pay any sum of money that
may be adjudged  the defendant in the suit, with costs.
Any order made by the Court, under the provisions of this
section, shall be open to appeal by the defendant.

77. Should a defendant offer, in lieu of bail for his appearance, to deposit a sum of money or other valuable property
sufficient to answer the claim against him, with the costs of
the suit, the Court may accept such deposit.

78. In the event of the defendant neither furnishing security
nor offering a suiiicient deposit, he may be committed to
custody until the decision of the suit, or if judgment be given
against the defendant until the execution of the decree, if the
Court shall so order.

79. If it shall appear to the Court that the arrest of the
defendant was applied for on insuhicient grounds, or if the
suit of the plaintif is dismissed or judgment is given against
him by default or otherwise, and it shall appear to the Court
that there was no probable ground for instituting the suit, the
Court may (on the application of the defendant) award against
the p1aintiE in its decree such amount, not exceeding the sum
of one thousand rupees, as it may deem a reasonable compensation to the defendant for any injury or loss which he may
have sustained by reason of such arrest. Provided that the
Court shall not award a larger amount‘ of compensation under
this section than it is competent to such Court to decree in

an action for damages An award of compensation under this
sectionshallbaranysuitfordamagesin respectofsuch
arrest. ‘

80. If in any suit the defendant is about to leave the
British territories in India, with intent to remain absent so
long that the plaintid‘ will or may thereby be obstructed or
delayed in the execution of any decree that may be passed
against the defendant, the p1aintiE may make an application
to the Court to the effect and in the manner aforesaid, and
the procedure thereupon shall be in all respects the same as
hereinbefore provided.

f
OF ATTACHMENT BEFORE JUDGMENT.

(J ' 81. If the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the
execution of any decree that may be passed against him, is
about to dispose of his property or any part thereof, or to
remove any such property from the jurisdiction of the Court
where the suit is pending, the plaintif may apply to the
Court, either at the time of the institution of the suit or at
any time thereafter until final judgment, to call upon the
defendant to furnish sufiicient security to fulfil any decree
that may be passed against him in the suit, and, onhis failing
to give such security, to direct that ‘any property, moveable
or immoveable, belonging to the defendant, shall be attached
until the further order of the Court.

82. The application shall contain a specification .of the
property required to be attached, and the estimated value of
each article or item thereof; and the plainti&' shall, at the
time of  the application, declare that the defendant is

about to  of or remove his property with such intent
as aforesaid.

83. If the Court, after examining the applicant, and 
such further investigation as it may consider necessary, shall

be satisfied that the defendant is about to dispose of or remove
his property, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of
the decree, it shall be lawful for the Court to issue a warrant
to the proper oEicer, commanding him to call upon the defendant, within a time to be fixed by the Court, either to
furnish security in such sum as may be specified in the order
to produce and place at the disposal of the Court when required the said property or the value of the same or such
portion thereof as may be suilicient to fulfil the .decree, or to
appear and show cause why he should not furnish security.
The Court may also in the warrant direct the attachment
until further order of the whole or any portion of the property
specified in the application.

84. If the defendant fail to show such cause or to furnish
the required security within the time fixed by the Court, the
Court may direct that the property specified in the application,
if not already attached, or such portion thereof as shall be
sufficient to fulfil the decree, shall be attached until further
order. If the defendant show such cause, or furnish the required security, and the property specified in the application
or any portion of it shall have been attached, the Court shall
order the attachment to be withdrawn.

85. The attachment shall be made according to the nature
of the property to be attached, in the manner hereinafter prescribed for the attachment of property in execution of a
decree for money. Any order for the attachment of property

under the preceding section shall be open to appeal by the
defendant.

86. In the event of any claim being preferred to the property attached before judgment, such claim shall be investigated in the manner hereinafter prescribed for the investigation of claims to property attached in execution of a decree
for money.

87. In all cases of attachment before judgment, the Court
which passed the order for the attachment shall at any time
remove the same, on the defendant furnishing security as
above required, together with security for the costs of the
attachment.

88. If it shall appear to the Court that the attachment was
applied for on insufiicient grounds, or if the suit of the plaintiff
is dismissed or judgment is given against him by default or
otherwise, and it shall appear to the Court that there was no
probable ground for instituting the suit, the Court may (on the
application of the defendant) award against the plaintiff in its
decree such amount, not exceeding the sum of one thousand
rupees, as it may deem a reasonable compensation to the defendant for the expense or injury occasioned to him by the
attachment of his property. Provided that the Court shall
not award a larger amount of compensation under this section
than it is competent to such Court to decree in an action,for
damages. An award of compensation under this section shall
bar any suit for damages in respect of such attachment. .

89. Attachments before judgment shall _not affect the
rights of persons not parties to the suit, nor bar any person
holding a decree against the defendant from applying for the
sale of the property under attachment in execution of such
decree.

90. If it shall appear to the Court by whose order the
property may have been attached before judgment, that there
is reasonable ground for supposing that the decree, in satisfaction of which the sale of the property is applied for, was
obtained by fraud or other improper means, the Court ‘may
refuse to allow the property to be sold in execution, if the
decree be a decree of that Court; or if it be a decree of
another Court, may stay the proceedings for a reasonable
time to enable the plaintiff in the pending suit to adopt proceedings to set aside the decree.

91. Whenever lands paying revenue to Government or a
tenure liable to summary sale under the provisions of
Regulation VIII. 1819 of the Bengal Code (to declare the
validity of certain tenure: and to define the relative rights of
Zemindars and Putnee Talookdars, gfc.) form the subject of a
suit,ifthepartyinpossession of such lands or tenure shall
neglect to pay the Government revenue or the rent due to
the proprietor’ of the estate, as the case may be, and a public
sale shall in consequence be ordered to take place, the party
not in possession shall, upon payment of the revenue or rent
due previously to the sale (and with or without security at
the discretion of the Court), be put in immediate possession
of the lands or tenure; and the Court in its decree may
award against the defendant the amount so paid, with interest
thereupon at such rate as to the Court may seem fit, or may
charge the amount so paid, with interest thereupon, at such
rate as the Court may order, in any adjustment of accounts
which may be directed in the final decree upon the suit.

OF INJUNCTIONS.

92. In any suit in which it shall be shown to the satisfaction
of the Court that any property which is in dispute in the
suit is in danger of being wasted, damaged, or alienated by
anypartytothe suit, it shall belawfulforthe Courttoissue
an injunction to such party, commanding him to refrain from
doing the particular act complained of, or to give such other
orders for the purpose of staying and preventing him from
wasting, damaging, or alienating the property, as’ to the
Court may seem meet. And in all cases in which it may
appear to the Court to be necessary for the preservation or
the better management or custody of any property which is
in dispute in a suit, it shall be lawful for the Court to appoint
a receiver or manager of such property, and, if need be, to
remove the person in whose possession or custody the property may be from the possession or custody thereof, and to
commit the same to the custody of such receiver or manager,
and to grant to such receiver or manager all such powers for
the management or the preservation and improvement of the
property, and the collection of the rents and profits thereof,
and the application and disposal of such rents and profits, as
to the Court may seem proper. If the property be land
paying revenue to Government, and it is considered that the
interests of those concerned will be promoted by the management of the Collector, the Court may appoint the Collector
to be receiver and manager of such land, unless the Government shall by any general order prohibit the appointment
of Collectors for such purpose, or shall in any particular case
prohibit the appointment of the Collector to be such receiver.

93. In any suit for restraining the defendant from the
committal of any breach of contract or other injury, and
whether the same be accompanied with any claim for damages
or not, it shall be lawful for the plaintiE, at any time after
the commencement of the suit, and whether before or after
judgment, to apply to the Court for an injunction to restrain
the defendant from the repetition, or the continuance of the
breach of contract or wrongful act complained of, or the committal of any breach of contract or injmy of a like kind
arising out of the same contract or relating to the same
property or right; and such injunction may be granted by
the Court on such terms as to the duration of the injunction,
keeping an account, giving security, or otherwise, as to such
Court shall seem reasonable and just, and in case of disobedience such injunction may be enforced by imprisonment in
the same manner as a decree for specific performance: provided always that any order for an injunction may be discharged or varied or set aside by the Court, on application
made thereto by any party dissatisfied with such order.

94. Any order made under either of the last two preceding
sections shall be open to appeal by the defendant.

95. The Court may in every case before granting an injunction direct such reasonable notice of the application for
the same to be given to the opposite party as it shall see fit.

96. If it shall appear to the Court that the injunction was
applied for on insufficient grounds, or if the claim of the
plaintiff is dismissed or judgment is given  him by
default or otherwise, and it shall appear to the Court that
there was no probable ground for instituting the suit, the
Court may (on the application of the defendant) award
against the plaintiff in its decree such sum, not exceeding
one thousand rupees, as it may deem a reasonable compensation to the defendant for the expense or injury occasioned
to him by the issue of the injunction. Provided that the
Court shall not award a larger amount of compensation under
this section than it is competent to such Court to decree in
an action for damages. An award of compensation under
this section shall bar any suit for damages in respect of the
issue of the injunction.

OF THE WITIIDRAWAL AND ADJUSTMENT OF SUITS.

97. If the plaintiff at any time before final judgment satisfy
the Court that there are suilicient grounds for permitting him
to withdraw from the suit with liberty to bring a fresh suit
for the same matter, it shall be competent to the Court to
grant such permission on such terms as to costs or otherwise
as it may deem proper. In any such fresh suit the p1ainti&'
shall be bound by the rules for the limitation of actions in the
same manner as if the first suit had not been brought. If
the plaintiff withdraw from the suit without such permission,
he shall be precluded from bringing a fresh suit for the same
matter.

98. If a suit shall be adjusted by mutual agreement or
compromise, or if the defendant satisfy the plaintiff in respect
to the matter of the suit, such agreement, compromise, or
satisfaction shall be recorded, and the suit shall be  of
in accordance therewith. On the application of the plaintiff
reciting the substance of such agreement, compromise, or
satisfaction, the Court, if satisfied that such agreement, compromise, or satisfaction has been actually entered into or
made, shall grant a certificate to the plaintiff authorizing him
to receive back from the Collector the full amount of stamp
duty paid on the plaint if the application shall have been presented before the settlement of issues, or half the amount if
presented at any time after the settlement of issues and before
any witness has been examined. Provided however that no
such certificate shall be granted if the adjustment between
the parties be such as to require a decree to pass on which
process of execution can be taken out.

OF THE DEATH, MARRIAGE, AND BANKRUPTCY, OR INSOLVENCY
OF PARTIES.

99. The death of a plaintiff or defendant shall not cause
the suit to abate if the cause of action survive.

100. If there be two or more plaintiffs or defendants and
one of. them die, and if the cause of action survive to the
surviving plaintiif or plaintiffs alone, or against the surviving
defendant or defendants alone, the suit shall proceed at the
instance of the surviving plaintid‘ or plaintiffs, and against
the surviving defendant or defendants.

101. If there be two or more p1ainti&‘s, and one of them
die, and if the cause of action shall not survive to the surviving plaintiE or plaintiffs alone but shall survive to them
and the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff jointly,
the Court may, on the application of the legal representative
of the deceased plaintiff, enter the name of such representative in the Register of the suit in the place of such deceased
plaintiff, and the suit shall proceed at the instance of the
surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs and such legal representative
of the deceased plaintidl If no application shall be made to
the Court by any person claiming to be the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff, the suit shall proceed at
the instance of the surviving plaintiff or plainti&'s; and the
legal representative of the deceased plaintiff shall be interested in and shall be bound by the judgment given in the
suit in the same manner as if the suit had procwded at his
instance conjointly with the surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs.

102. In case of the death of a sole plaintiif or sole
surviving plaintif, the Court may, on the application of the
legal representative of such plaintim enter the name of such
representative in the place of such plaintiff in the Register
of the suit, and the suit shall thereupon proceed; if no such
application shall be made to the Court within what it may
consider a reasonable time by any person claiming to be the
legal representative of the deceased sole plaintiff or sole
surviving plaintid‘, it shall be competent for the Court to pass
an order that the suit shall abate, and to award to the defendant the reasonable cost which he may have incurred in
defending the suit, to be recovered from the estate of the
deceased sole plaintiif or surviving plaintiE; or the Court
may, if it think proper, on the application of the defendant,
and upon such terms as to costs as may seem fit, pass such
other order for bringing in the legal representative of the
deceased sole plaintiff or surviving plaintiff, and for proceeding with the suit in order to a final determination of the
matters in dispute, as may appear just and proper in the
circumstances of the case.

103. If any dispute arise as to who is the legal representative of a deceased plaintiff, it shall be competent to the Court
either to stay the suit until the fact has been duly determined in another suit, or to decide at or before the hearing
of the suit who shall be admitted to be such legal representative for the purpose of prosecuting the suit.

104. If there be two or more defendants, and one of them
die, and the cause of action shall not survive against the
surviving defendant or defendants alone, and also in case of
the death of a sole defendant or sole surviving defendant,
where the action survives, the plaintid‘ may make an application to the Court, specifying the name, description, and place
of abode of any person whom the plaintiff alleges to be the
legal representative of such defendant, and whom he desires
to be made the defendant in his stead; and the Court shall
thereupon enter the name of such representative in the
Register of the suit in the place of such defendant, and shall
issue a summons to him to appear on a day to be therein
mentioned to defend the suit; and the case shall thereupon
proceed in the same manner as if such representative had

originally been made a defendant and had been a party to
the former proceedings in the suit.

105. The marriage of a woman, plaintiff or defendant,
shall not cause the suit to abate, but the suit may, notwithstanding, be proceeded with to judgment, and the decree
thereupon may be executed upon the wife alone; and if the
case is one in which the husband is by law liable for the
debts of his wife, the decree may, with the permission of the
Court, be executed against the husband also; and in case of
judgment for the wife, execution of the decree may, with the
permission of the Court, be issued upon the application of
the husband, where the husband is by law entitled to the
money or thing which may be the subject of the decree.

106. The bankruptcy or insolvency of the plaintiff in any

suit which the assignee might maintain for the benefit of the
creditors shall not be a valid objection to the continuance of

such suit, unless the assignee shall decline to continue the

suit and to give security for the costs thereof within such
reasonable time as the Court may order; if the assignee
neglect or refuse to continue the suit and to give such
security within the time limited by the order, the defendant
may, within eight days after such neglect or refusal, plead
the bankruptcy or insolvency of the plaintiff as a reason for
abating the suit.

110. If, on the day fixed for the defendant to appear and
answer, or any other day subsequent thereto to which the
hearing of the suit may be adjourned, neither party shall
appear either in person or by a pleader when duly called
upon by the Court, the suit shall be dismissed. Whenever
a suit is dismissed under the provisions of this section, the
plaintiff shall be at liberty to bring a fresh suit, unless precluded by the rules for the limitation of actions; or if he
shall within the period of thirty days satisfy the Court that
there was a sufficient excuse for his non-appearance, the

Court may issue a fresh summons upon the plaint already
filed.

111. If the plaintiff shall appear in person or by a pleader,

fixed for his appearance.

112. If the plaintiff shall appear in person or by a pleader,

and the defendant shall not appear in person or by a pleader,
and.it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the

and may direct notice of such day to be given to the
defendant.

114. If the defendant shall appear in person or by a
pleader, and the plaintiff shall not appear in person or by a
pleader, the Court shall pass judgment against the plaintiff
by default, unless the defendant admit the claim, in which
case the Court shall pass judgment against the defendant
upon such admission. When judgment is passed  a
plaintiff by default, he shall be precluded from bringing a
fresh suit in respect of the same cause of action.

115. When there are two or more plaintills, any one or
more of them may be authorized to appear, plead, and act
for the other or others of them; and in like manner, when

authorized, the Court shall proceed with the suit to judgment, and shall at the time of  judgment give such
order with respect to the defendant or defendants who shall
not have appeared as shall be just and proper in the circumstances of the case.

117. If any plaintiff or defendant who shall have been
ordered or summoned to appear personally under the provisions of Section 42, shall not appear in person, or show

to appear, such plaintiff or defendant shall be subject to all
the provisions of the foregoing sections applicable to plaintiffs
and defendants respectively, who do not appear either in
person or by pleader. f '

118. In support of the cause shown by a plaintiff or
defendant for failure to appear in person, the Court shall

any sufficient cause from appearing when the suit was called
on for hearing, the Court shall pass an order to set aside the
judgment, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the

suit. In all cases of judgment against a plaintif by default,
he may apply, within thirty days from the date of the judgment, for an order to set it aside; and if it shall be proved
to the satisfaction of the Court that the plaintiff was prevented by any sufiicient cause from appearing when the suit
was called on for hearing, the Court shall pass an order to
set aside the judgment by default, and shall appoint a day
for proceeding with the suit. But no judgment shall be set
aside on any such application as aforesaid, unless notice
thereof have been served on the opposite party. In all cases
in which the Court shall pass an order under this section for
setting aside a judgment, the order shall be final ; but in all
appealable cases in which the Court shall reject the application, an appeal shall lie from the order of rejection to the
tribunal to which the final decision in the suit would be
appealable, provided that the appeal be preferred within the
time allowed for an appeal from such final decision, and be
written upon stamp paper of the value prescribed for petitions
to the Court where a stamp is required for petitions.

hearing of the suit written statements of their respective
cases, and the Court shall receive the same and put them on
the record. Such statements shall be written on the stamp
paper prescribed for petitions to the Court where a stamp is
required for petitions.

121. If in a suit for debt the defendant desire to set»o&'
against the claim of the plaintiff the amount of any debt due
to him from the plaintiff, he shall tender a written statement
containing the particulars of his demand, and the Court shall
thereupon inquire into the same. Provided that, if the sum
claimed by the defendant exceed the amount cognisable by
the Court, the defendant shall not be allowed to set-oh‘ the
same unless he abandon the excess. —

122. No written statement shall be received after the first
hearing of the suit, unless called for by the Court. But it
shall be competent to the Court, at any time before iinal
judgment, to call for a written statement, or an additional
written statement, from any of the parties. When such statements are called for by the Court, they shall be received on I

plain paper.

123. Written statements shall be as brief as the nature of
the case will admit, and ‘shall not be argumentative, nor by
way of answer one to the other; but each statement shall be
con£ned, as much as possible, to a simple narrative of the
facts which the party by whom or on whose behalf the
written statement is made believes to be material to the case,
and which he believes he will be able to prove if called upon
by the Court. Written statements shall be subscribed and
verified in the manner hereinbefore provided for subscribing
and verifying plaints, and no written statement shall be
received unless it be so subscribed and verified.

124. If it shall appear to the Court that any written statement presented by or on behalf of a party, whether the same
have been spontaneously tendered or have been called for by

the Court, is argumentative or unnecessarily prolix, or that
it contains matter irrelevant to the suit, the Court may reject
the same, and return it to the party with the order of rejection endorsed thereon; and it shall not be competent to ‘a
party whose written statement has been rejected for any of
these causes to present another written statement, unless it
shall be expressly called for or allowed by the Court.

Court may postpone the hearing of the suit to a future day,
and direct that such party shall attend in person on such
day; and if the party so directed to attend shall, without
lawful excuse, fail to appear in person on the day to be so

have been served on them respectively within a reasonable
time before the hearing of the suit; and no documentary evidence of any kind, which the parties or any of them may desire

chargeable with stamp duty under any Regulation or Act for
the time being in force, and it shall appear to the Court that
the deed, instrument, or writing, although written on stamp

its production shall pay into Court the deficiency of the
stamp duty and a penalty equal to ten times the amount of
the deficiency. Provided that, if it shall appear to the Court
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the deed,
instrument, or writing was not properly stamped with the
intention of evading the stamp laws, the Court may reject the
same. '

I

131. An entry of the fact of such payment and of the
amount thereof shall be made in a book to be kept in the

the number and title of the suit, and the name of the party
from whom such monies were received, and the date (if any)
and description of the document, for the purpose of identifying the same; and the Court shall pay over the said monies
to the Collector of Revenue, or to such person as he may
appoint to receive the same; and the Collector of Revenue
or other proper authority shall, upon production of the deed,
instrument, or writing, with the endorsement hereinbefore
mentioned, cause such additional stamp as may be necessary
to be affixed to such deed, instrument, or Writing in respect of

the record. Provided that, if the exhibit be an entry in any
shop book or other book, the party on whose behalf such
book is produced shall furnish a copy of the entry, which

of the record, and the book shall be returned to the party
producing it.

133. No stamp ‘duty shall be leviable in respect of the
production or filing of any exhibit, anything contained in
any Regulation or Act notwithstanding.

134. When an exhibit is rejected by the Court, it shall be
endorsed in the manner specified in Section 132, with the

think proper, for special reasons (as on suspicion of forgery),
to detain it.

135. When the time for preferring an appeal from the
decision passed in the suit has elapsed, or if an appeal has

been preferred from such decision, then after the appeal has
been finally disposed of, any person, whether a party to the
suit or not, who may be desirous of receiving back any
exhibit produced by him in the suit, shall be entitled, on
application to the Court in which such exhibit may be, to
receive back the same unless the further use of such exhibit
has been superseded by the terms of the decree, or the Court
has direxzted it to be detained for purposes of public justice.

136. Any exhibit may be returned before the time mentioned in the last preceding section, if the Court in which the
document may be shall think proper, for special reasons, to
order its return. But in every case a copy, properly certified, and made at the expense of the applicant, shall be substituted for the original in the record of the suit.

137. Whenever an exhibit once received by a Court of
Justice and admitted in evidence is returned, a receipt shall

be given by the party receiving it in a receipt-book kept for «

the purpose.

138. Any Civil Court may of its own accord, or upon the
application of any of the parties to a suit, send for, either
from its own record or from any other public o$ce or court,
the record of any other suit or case, or any other oiiicial
papers (not being documents relating to affairs of State, the
production of which would be contrary to good policy), and
inspect the same, when the inspection of such record or
papers shall appear likely to elucidate the facts of the suit
before the Court, and to promote the ends of justice.

OF THE SETTLEMENT OF ISSUES.

139. At the first hearing of the suit the Court shall
enquire and ascertain upon what questions of law or fact the
parties are at issue, and shall thereupon proceed to frame
and record the issues of law and fact_ on which the right

decision of the case may depend. The Court may frame the
issues from the allegations of fact which it collects from the
oral examination of the parties or their pleadem, notwithstanding any ditference between such allegations of fact and
the allegations of fact contained in the written statements,
if any, tendered by the parties or their pleaders.

140. If the Court shall be of opinion that the issues cannot
be correctly framed without the examination of some person
other than the persons already before the Court or without
the reading of some document not produced by any of such
persons, it may adjourn the framing of the issues to a future
day, to be fixed by the Court, and may compel the attendance
of such person, or the production of the document by the
person in whose hands it may be, by summons or other
suitable process.

141. At any time before the decision of the case, the Court
may amend the issues or frame additional issues on such

terms as to it shall seem fit, and all such amendments as

may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real
question or controversy between the parties shall be so made.

OF ISSUES BY AGREEMENT OF PARTIES.

142. When the parties to a suit are agreed as to the question or questions of fact or of law to be decided between
them, they may state the same in the form of an issue, and

in the adirmative or the negative of such issue, a sum of
money specified in the agreement, or to be ascertained by the
Court upon a question inserted in the issue for that purpose,
shall be paid by one of the parties to the other_of them, or
that upon such  some property specified in the agreement, and in dispute in the suit, shall be delivered by one
of the parties to the other of them, or that upon such 

one or more of the parties shall do or perform some particular
legal act, or shall refrain from doing or performing some
particular act, specified in the agreement, and having reference
to the matter in dispute.

143. If the Court shall be satisfied, after an examination
of the parties or their pleaders, and taking such evidence as
it may deem proper, that the agreement was duly executed
by the parties, and that the parties have a bond jide interest
in the decision of such question, and that the same is fit to
be tried and decided, it may proceed to record and try the
same, and deliver its finding or opinion thereon in the same
manner -as if the issue had been framed by the Court, and
may, upon the finding or decision on such issue, give judgment for the sum so agreed on or so ascertained as aforesaid,
or otherwise, according to the terms of the agreement; and
upon the judgment which shall be so given, decree shall
follow, and may be executed in the same way as if the judgment had been pronounced in a contested suit.

WHEN THE SUIT MAY BE DISPOSED OF AT THE FIRST
HEARING.

144. If at the first hearing of a suit_ it shall appear that
the parties are not at issue on any question of law or fact,
the Court may at once give judgment.

145. When the parties are at issue on some question of
law. or fact, and issues have been framed by the Court as
hereinbefore provided, if the Court shall be satisfied that no
further argument or evidence than such as the parties or
their pleaders can at once supply is required upon any such
of the issues of law or fact as may be suiiicient for the decision of the suit, the Court, after hearing such argument and
evidence, may proceed to determine such issue or issues, and
if the finding thereon is sufficient for the decision, may pronounce judgment accordingly, whether the summons shall

have been issued for the settlement of issues only or for the
final  of the suit; otherwise the Court shall postpone
the further hearing of the suit, and shall fix a day for the production of such further evidence or for such further argument
as the case may require. Provided that if the summons
shall have been issued for the final  of the suit and
either party shall fail without sutlicient cause to produce the
evidence on which he relies, the Court may at once give
judgment.
OF ADJOURNMENTS.

146. The Court may, if sutiicient cause be shown, at any
stage of the suit, grant time to the parties, or to either of
them, and may from time to time adjourn the hearing of the
suit; and in all such cases the Court shall fix a day for the
further hearing of the suit. Provided that in all such cases
the party applying for time shall pay the costs occasioned by
such adjournment, unless the Court shall otherwise direxzt.

147. If, on any day to which the hearing of the suit may
be adjourned, the parties or either of them shall not appear
in person or by pleader, the Court may proceed to dispose

of the suit in the manner specified in Section 110, Section 111,
or Section 114, as the case may be, or may make such other

order as may appear to be just and proper in the circumstances of the case. .

148. If either party to a suit to whom time may have
been granted shall fail to produce his proofs, or to cause the
attendance of his witnesses, or to perform any other act for

which time may have been allowed, the Court shall proceed

to a decision of the suit on the record, notwithstanding such
default.

149. The parties or their pleaders may, at any time after
the issue of the summons to the defendant, if the summons

be for the final disposal of the suit, or alter the issues have
been recorded if the summons to the defendant be for the
settlement of issues only, obtain, on application to the Court,
summonses to witnesses or other persons to attend either to
give evidence or to produce documents, and in any such

summons the names of any number of persons may be

to attend, and for one day’s attendance. If the Court be a
subordinate Court, regard shall be had, in fixing the scale
of such expenses, to the rules  any) established by the
Court to which such Court shall be immediately subordinate.
The sum so paid into Court shall be tendered to the witness
or other person at the time of serving the summons, if it .can
be served personally. If it shall appear to the Court that
the sum paid into Court on account of the travelling and
other expenses of the witness or other person in passing to
and from the Court is not sufficient to cover such expenses,
the Court may direct such further sum to be paid to the
witness or other person as may appear to be necessary on that
account, and, in case of default in payment, may order such
sum to be levied by attachment and sale of the goods of
the person ordered to pay the same, or may discharge the
witness without requiring him to give evidence. If it shall

be necessary to detain the witness or other person summoned
for a longer period than one day, the Court may from time

to time order the party at whose instance he was summoned
to pay into Court such sum as may be suiiicient to defray the
expenses of his detention for such further period, and, in
default of such’ deposit being made, may order the witnes
to be discharged without requiring him to give evidence.

produce, shall be described in the summons with convenient
certainty.

produce the document, at a time and place to be named
therein, to be alhxed in some conspicuous place upon his
house or place of abode; and if such person shall not attend
at the time and place named in such proclamation, the Court
may, at the instance of the party on whose application the
summons was issued, make an order for the attachment of the

172. On the day appointed for the hearing of the suit, or
on some other day to which the hearing may be adjourned,
the evidence of the witnesses in attendance shall be taken
orally in open Court, in the presence and hearing, and under
the personal direction and superintendence of the Judge. In
cases in which an appeal lies to a higher tribunal, the evidence of each witness given upon such examination shall be
taken down in writing, in the language in ordinary use in proceedings before the Court, by, or in the presence and under the
personal direction and superintendence of the Judge, not
ordinarily in the form of question and answer but in that of a
narrative, and, when completed, shall be read over in the
presence of the Judge and of the witness, and also in the
presence of the parties to the suit or their pleaders, or such of
them as are in attendance, and shall, if necessary, be corrected,
and shall be signed by the Judge. If the evidence be taken
down in a different language from that in which it has been

given, and the witness does not understand the language in
which it is taken down, the witness may require his deposition
as taken down in writing to be interpreted to him in the
language in which it was given. Where all the parties to
the suit present, and the pleaders of such as are absent, consent to have such evidence as is given in English taken down
in English, the Judge may so take it down in his own hand.
It shall be in the discretion of the Court to take down, or
cause to be taken down, any particular question and answer,
if there shall appear any special reason for so doing, or any
party or his pleader shall require it. If any question put to
a witness be objected to by either of the parties or their
pleaders, and the Court shall allow the same to be put, the
question and answer shall be taken down, and the objection,
and the name of the party making it, shall be noticed in
taking down the depositions, together with the decision of the
Court upon the objection. The Court shall record such remarks as it may think material respecting the demeanour of
the witness while under examination. In cases in which the
evidence is not taken down in writing by the Judge himself,
he shall be bound, as the examination of each witness proceeds, to make a memorandum of the substance of what such
witness deposes, and such memorandum shall be written and
signed by the Judge with his own hand, and shall accompany
the record. In cases in which an appeal does not lie to a
higher tribunal, it shall not be necessary to take down the
depositions of the witnesses in writing at length; but the
Judge, as the examination of each witness proceeds, shall
make a memorandum of the substance of what such witness
deposes, and such memorandum shall be written and signed by
the Judge with his own hand, and shall form part of the
record. If the Judge shall be prevented from  a
memorandum as above required, he shall record the reason of
his inability to do so, and in cases not appealable shall cause

such memorandum to be made in writing from his dictation
in open Court, and shall  the same, and such memorandum
shall form part of the record.

17 3. If a witness be about to leave the jurisdiction of the
Court, or other good and suflicient cause can be shown to the
satisfaction of the Court why his examination should be taken
immediately, it shall be competent to the Court, upon the
application of either party or of the witness, at any time after
the institution of the suit, to take the examination of such
witness forthwith, or on any day that may be fixed for that
purpose, of which due notice shall be given to the parties if
the day be fixed in their absence. The witness shall be
examined, and his deposition shall be taken down in writing,
in the manner hereinbefore prescribed; and the deposition
so taken down may be read in evidence at any hearing of the
suit.

174. All witnesses shall be examined upon oath or ailirmation, or otherwise according to the provisions of the law for
the time being in force in relation to the examination of
witnesses.

OF COMMISSIONS TO EXAMINE ABSENT WITNESSES AND
MAKE LOCAL ENQUIRIES.

175. When the evidence of a witness is required who is
resident at some place distant more than a hundred miles
from the place where the Court is held, or who is unable
from sickness or infirmity to attend before the Court to be
personally examined, or is a person exempted by reason of
rank or sex from personal appearance in Court; the Court
may, of its own motion, or on the application of any of the
parties to the suit, or on the representation of the witness,
order a Commission to issue for the examination of such
witness on interrogatories or otherwise; and may, by the
same or any subsequent order, give all such directions for

taking such examinations as may appear reasonable and just.
If the witness be resident within the jurisdiction of the Court
issuing the Commission, the Commission may be issued to
any oHicer of the Court, or to any subordinate Court, or to
any other person or persons whom the Court issuing the
Commission may think proper to appoint. If the witness be
resident at some place which is beyond the jurisdiction ‘of the
Court issuing the Commission, and not within the local jurisdiction of Her Majesty’s Supreme Court, but within the
jurisdiction of the Sudder Court, the Commission shall ordinarily be issued to the Court within whose jurisdiction the
witness may reside, and which can most conveniently execute
the same; but, under special circumstances, the Commission
may be issued to any other person or persons whom the Court
issuing the Commission may think proper to appoint.

176. If the witness be resident within the local jurisdiction
of Her Majesty's Supreme Court, the Commission shall ordinarily be issued to the Court of Small Causes held under
A.ctIX.of1850 (fm-thsmora¢as,yrecoveryofm.alldebtsand
demands in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay), but may, under
special circumstances, be directed to any person or persons
whom the Court issuing the Commission may think proper to
appoint.

17 7 . When the evidence of a witness is required, who is
resident at some place not within the jurisdiction of the
Sudder Court or of Her Majesty's Supreme Court, but within
the British territories in India or within the territories of a
Native Prince or State in alliance with the British Government, the Court, if it be satished that the evidence of such
witness is necessary, may, of its own motion or on the representation of any of the parties to the suit, issue a Commission
for the ‘examination of the witness; provided that, if the suit
be pending in any Court subordinate to the principal Civil
Court of a District, such subordinate Court shall not issue the

Commission, but the principal Civil Court of the District

may issue the Commission on the application of the subordinate Court.

17 8. When the evidence of a witness is required, who is
resident at some place beyond the said territories and not
within the territories of a Native Prince or State in alliance
with the British Government, the Sudder Court, if the suit in
which the evidence of the witness is required be pending in
that Court and the Court be satisfied that such evidence is
necessary, may, of its own motion or on the application of
any of the parties to the suit, issue a Commission to examine
the witness; if the suit be not pending in the Sudder Court,
that Court may issue the Commission on the application of
the Court inwhich the suit is pending. In all suchcases,
the Commission may be issued to any person or persons
whom the Sudder Court may think proper to appoint.

179. After the Commission has been duly executed, it
shall be returned, together with the deposition of the witness
who may have been examined thereunder, to the Court out
of which the Commission issued, unless otherwise directed by
the order for issuing the Commission, in which case it shall
be returned in terms of such order, and the Commission and
the return thereto and the deposition of the witness who may
have been examined under such Commission shall in all
cases form part of the record of the suit. But no deposition
taken under a Commission shall be read in evidence without
the consent of the party against whom the same may be
oR'ered, unless it be proved that the deponent is beyond the
jurisdiction of the Court, or dead, or unable from sickness or
infirmity to attend to be personally examined, or distant,
without collusion, more than a hundred miles from the place
where the Court is held, or exempted by reason of rank or
sex from personal appearance in Court, or unless the Court

shall, at its discretion, dispense with the proof of any of the

above circumstances, or shall authorise the deposition of any
witness being read in evidence, notwithstanding proof that
the causes for  such deposition have ceased at the time

of reading the same.

180. In any suit or other judicial proceeding in which the
Court may deem a local investigation to be requisite or
proper for the purpose of elucidating the matters _in dispute,
or of  the amount of any mesne profits or damages,
the Court may issue a Commission to an otiicer of the Court
appointed to execute such Commissions, or, if there be no
such otiicer, to any suitable person, directing him to make
such investigation and to report thereon to the Court. In
all such cases, unless otherwise directed by the order of
appointment, the Commissioner shall have power to examine
any witnesses who may be produced to him by‘ the parties or
any of them, the parties themselves, and any other persons
whom he may think proper to call upon to give evidence in
the matters referred to him; and also to call for and examine
documents and other papers relevant to the subject of inquiry;
and persons not attending on the requisition of the Commissioner, or refusing to give their testimony or to produce any
documents or other papers, shall be subject to the like disadvantages, penalties, and punishments, by order of the
Court on the report of the Commissioner, as they would
incur for the same offences in suits tried before the Court.
The Commissioner, after such local inspection as he may
deem necessary, and after reducing to writing, in the manner
hereinbefore prescribed for taking the depositions of witnesses
in the presence of the Judge, the depositions taken by him,
shall return the depositions, together with his report in
writing, subscribed with his name, to the Court. The report
and depositions shall be taken as evidence in the suit and
shall form part of the record; but it shall be competent to
the Court, or to the parties to the suit or any of them, with

the permission of the Court, to examine the Commissioner
personally in open Court, touching any of the matters referred
to him or mentioned in his report, or the manner in which he
may have conducted the investigation.

18]. In any suit or other judicial proceeding in which an
investigation or adjustment of accounts may be necessary,
it shall  lawful for the Court to appoint such officer or other
person as aforesaid to be a Commissioner for the purpose of
making such investigation or adjustment, and to direct that
the parties or their attorneys or pleaders shall attend upon
the Commissioner during such investigation or adjustment.
In all such cases, the Court shall furnish the Commissioner
with such part of the proceedings and such detailed instructions as may appear necessary for his information and
guidance, and the instructions shall distinctly specify whether
the Commissioner is merely to transmit the proceedings
which he may hold on the inquiry or also to report his own
opinion on the. point referred for his investigation. The proceedings of the Commissioner shall be received in evidence
in the case, unless the Court may have reason to be dissatisfied with them; in which case the Court shall make such
further inquiry as may be requisite, and shall pass such
ultimate judgment or order as may appear to it to be right
and proper in the circumstances of the case.

182. Whenever a Commission is issued either for taking
evidence or for a local investigation or an investigation into
accounts, the Court, before  the Commission, may
order such sum as may be thought reasonable for the expenses
of the Commission to be paid into Court by the party at
whose instance or for whose benefit the Commission is issued.

satisfy the Court that he has duly applied such property of the
deceased as shall be proved to have come into his possemion,
the decree may be executed against the defendant to the
extent of the property not duly applied by him, in the same
manner as if the decree had been against the defendant personally. '

204. Whenever a person has become liable as security for
the performance of a decree or of any part thereof, the decree
may be executed against such person to the extent to which
he has rendered himself liable, in the same manner as a decree may be enforced against a defendant.

money, bank-notes, cheques, bills of exchange, promissory

made is desirous of enforcing the same, he shall apply to the
Court whose duty it is to execute the decree either in person
or through his pleader in the suit or some other pleader duly

more decree-holders, one or more of them may make the application, if the Court shall see sufiicient cause for allowing
him or them to make such application; and the Court shall
in such case pass such order as it may deem necessary for protecting the interests of the other decree-holders.

208. If a decree shall be transferred by assignment or by
operation of law from the original decree-holder to any other
person, application for the execution of the decree may be
made by the person to whom it shall have been so transferred
or his pleader; and if the Court shall think proper to grant
such application, the decree may be executed in the same

manner as if the application were made by the  decree-holder.

209. If there be cross-decrees between the same parties for

the payment of money, execution shall be taken out by that
party only who shall have obtained a decree for the larger

sum, and for so much only as shall remain after deducting the

entered on the decree for the larger sum as well as satisfaction
on the decree for the smaller sum, and if both sums shall be
equal, satisfaction shall be entered upon both decrees.

execution as well as to decrees in the same Court.

Whenever a suit shall be pending in any Court against the
holder of a decree of such Court, by the person or persons

appear just and reasonable to do so, stay execution on the
decree either absolutely or on such terms as it may think just,
until a decree shall be passed in the pending suit.

or damages due upon it, or other relief granted by the decree; the amount of costs, if any were awarded; the name
of the person against whom the enforcement of the decree is
sought; and the mode in which the assistance of the Court is

required, whether by the delivery of property specifically
decreed, the arrest and imprisonment of the person named,

or attachment of his property, or otherwise as the case
may be.

213. When the application is for an attachment of any
land or other immoveable property belonging to the defendant, it shall be accompanied with an inventory or list of such
property, containing such a description of the property as
may be sufficient to identify it, together with a specification
of the defendant’s share or interest therein, to the best of the
applicant’s belief and so far as he has been able to ascertain
the same. And where the property is an estate paying
revenue to Government or any portion of such estate, the
application for an attachment shall be accompanied with an
authenticated extract from the Register of the Collector's
Oliice, specifying the revenue of such estate, and the names
and (where registered) the shares of the registered proprietors.

214. Where the application is for an attachment of the
defendant’s moveable property or any part thereof, it may be

of a decree containing the particulars above mentioned, or
such of them as may be applicable to the case, shall cause
the same to be compared with the original decree contained
in the record of the suit, and if they shall be found to correspond therewith, shall enter a note of the application, and the
date on which it was made, in the register of the suit. If the
particulars shall not be found to correspond with the original
decree, the Court shall either return the application for correction to the person making it, or shall, with the consent of
such person, cause the necessary correction to be made. .If
the application be admitted, the Court shall order execution

of the decree according to the nature of the application.

elapsed between the date of the decree and the application for
its execution, or if the enforcement of the decree be applied
for against the heir or representative of an original party to

the suit, the Court shall issue a notice to the party 
whom execution may be applied for requiring him to show

cause, within a limited period to be fixed by the Court, why
the decree should not be executed against him. Provided
that no such notice shall be necessary in consequence of an
interval of more than one year having elapsed, between the
date of the decree and the application for execution, if the
application be made within one year from the date of the last
order passed on any previous application for execution; and
provided further that no such notice shall be necessary in
consequence of the application being against an heir or representative, if upon a previous application for execution

not be forthwith executed, the Court shall order it to be executed accordingly. If the party shall attend in person or by
a pleader, and shall offer any objection to the enforcement of
the decree, the Court shall pass such order as in the circumstances of the case may appear to be just and proper.

218. Where the application is for a general attachment of

the moveable property of the defendant, it shall be competent
to the Court, if it shall think proper, before issuing an order
for such attachment, to require the applicant to give security
to the satisfaction of the Court, in such sum as may be considered adequate, for any injury that may be occasioned by
the attachment of property belonging to any other person
than the defendant.

219. Before granting the order for a general attachment or
at the instance of the plaintiff at any time after judgment
and before complete execution of the decree, the Court may
summon the person against whom the application is made
and examine him as to the property liable to be seized in
satisfaction of the judgment. The Court may also, of its own
motion or at the instance of any person interested in the
enquiry, summon any other person whom it may think
necessary and examine him in respect to such property, and
may require the person summoned to produce all deeds and
documents in his possession or power relating to such property.

220. In all cases in which a summons may be issued for
the attendance of a party to a suit or any other person at any
time after judgment, the rules applicable to the summoning

the matter of the complaint and pass such order as may be
proper under the circumstances of the case.

necessary to prevent the continuance of such obstruction or
resistance.

defendant, the claim shall be numbered and registered as a
suit between the decree-holder as plaintitf and the claimant

the decree-holder to  him of such property under the
decree on the ground that the property was bond jide in his
possession on his own account or on account of some other
person than the defendant, and that it was not included in
the decree, or, if included in the decree, that he was not a
party to the suit in which the decree was passed, he may apply
to the Court within one month from the date of such dispossession; and if, after examining the applicant, it shall appear
to the Court that there is probable cause for making the application, the application shall be numbered and registered as
a suit between the applicant as plaintiff, and the decreeholder as defendant, and the Court shall proceed to investigate the matter in dispute in the same manner and with the
like powers as if a suit for the property had been instituted
by the applicant against the decree-holder.

231. The decision passed by the Court under either of the
last two sections shall be of the same force as a decree in an

ordinary suit, and shall be subject to appeal under the rules

pay and apply such rents, profits, or receipts towards the payment of the amount of the decree and costs; or when the
property attached shall consist of land, if the judgment debtor
can satisfy the Court that there is reasonable ground to believe
that the amount of the judgment may be raised by the mortgage of the land, or by letting it on lease, or by disposing by
private sale of a portion of the land or of any other property
belonging to the judgment debtor, it shall be competent to
the Court, on the application of the judgment debtor, to postpone the sale for such period as it may think proper to enable
the judgment debtor to raise the amount. In any case in which
a manager shall be appointed under this section, such manager
shall be bound to render due and proper accounts of his receipts
and disbursements from time to time as the Court may direct.

244. When in any district, where land paying revenue to
Government is ordinarily sold by the Collector, as provided in
Section 248, the property attached shall consist of any such
land, or of a share in any such land, if the Collector shall
represent to the Court that the public sale of the land or share
is objectionable, and that satisfaction of the decree may be
made within a reasonable period by a temporary alienation of
the land or share, the Court may authorize the Collector, on
security for the amount of the decree or for the value of such
land or share being given, to make provision for such satisfaction in the manner recommended by the Collector, instead of
proceeding to a public sale of the land or share.

245. If the amount decreed with costs and all charges and
expenses which may be incurred by the attachment be paid
into Court, or if satisfaction of the decree be otherwise made,
an order shall be issued for the withdrawal of the attachment;
and if the defendant shall desire it and shall deposit in Court
a sum suflicient to cover the expense, the order shall be proclaimed or intimated in the same manner as hereinbefore
prescribed for the proclamation or intimation of the attachment; and such steps shall be taken as may be necessary for
staying further proceedings in execution of the decree.

OF CLAIMS TO ATTACHED PROPERTY.

246. In the event of any claim being preferred to, or objection offered against the sale of lands or any other immoveable
or moveable property which may have been attached in execution of a decree or under any order for attachment passed
before judgment, as not liable to be sold in execution of a
decree against the defendant, the Court shall, subject to the
proviso contained in the next succeeding section, proceed to
investigate the same with the like powers as if the claimant
had been originally made a defendant to the suit, and also

with such powers as regards the summoning of the original

defendant as are contained in Section 220. And if it shall
appear to the satisfaction of the Court that the land or other
immoveable or moveable property was not in the possession of
the party  whom execution is sought, or of some other
person in trust for him, or in the occupancy of ryots or cultivators or other persons paying rent to him at the time when
the property was attached, or that, being in the possession of
the party himself at such time, it was so in his possession not
on his own account or as his own property, but on account of
or in trust for some other person, the Court shall pass an
order for releasing the said property from attachment. But

if it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Court that the land

or other immoveable or moveable property was in possession
of the party  whom execution is sought, as his own
property, and not on account of any other person, or was in
the possession of some other person in trust for him, or in the
occupancy of ryots or cultivators or other persons paying rent
to him at the time when the property was attached, the Court
shall disallow the claim. The order which may be passed by
the Court under this section shall not be subject to appeal,
but the party against whom the order may be given shall be
at liberty to bring a suit to establish his right at any time
within one year from the date of the order.

247. The claim or objection shall be made at the earliest
opportunity to the Court which shall have ordered the attachment; and if the property to which the claim or objection
applies, shall have been advertized for sale, the sale may (if it
appears necessary) be postponed for the purpose of making
the investigation mentioned in the last preceding section.
Provided that no such investigation shall be made if it appear
that the making of the claim or objection was designedly and
unnecessarily delayed, with a view to obstruct the ends of
justice. The order disallowing the investigation shall not be
subject to appeal, and the claimant shall be left to prosecute
his claim by a regular suit.

or SALES IN EXECUTION or nsoanss.

248. Sales in execution of decrees shall be conducted by an
oiiicer of the Court or by any other person whom the Court may
appoint, and shall in all cases be made by public auction in manner hereinafter mentioned. Provided that if the property to be
sold shall consist of negotiable securities or of shares in any railway, banking, or other public company or corporation, it shall
be competent to the Court, instead of directing the sale to be
made by public auction, to authorize the sale of such securities

or shares through a broker at the market-rate of the day. If
the property to be sold shall be land paying revenue to
Government and the Government shall so direct, the sale

shall be conducted by the Collector on the requisition of the
Court.

249. In all cases of intended sale by public auction, whether
of moveable or immoveable property, in execution of a decree,
a proclamation of the intended sale, specifying the time and
place of sale, the property to be sold, the revenue assessed
upon the estate when the property to be sold is an estate or a
part of an estate paying revenue to Government, and the
amount for the recovery of which the sale is ordered, together
with any other particulars that the Court may think necessary,
shall be made in the current language of the district. The
proclamation shall also declare that the sale extends only to
the right, title, and interest of the defendant in the property
specified therein. Such proclamation shall be made on the
spot where the property is attached by beat of drum or in
such other mode as may be customary; and a written notification to the same effect shall be allixed in the Court-house
of the Judge who shall have ordered the sale, and in some
conspicuous spot in the town or village in which the attachment may have taken place. When the property ordered to
be sold may consist of land or of any right or interest in land,
the written notification shall also be affixed in the oflice of the
Collector of the district in which such land is situate and in
the Courthouse of the principal Civil Court of the district
where the Court which ordered the sale is subordinate to such
Court. The sale shall not take place until after the expiration of at least thirty days in the case of immoveable property,
and of at least fifteen days in the case of moveable property,
calculated from the date on which the notification shall have
been affixed in the Court-house of the Judge ordering the
sale.

250. The usual process for attachment and sale when the
property to be attached consists of goods, chattels, or other
personal estate other than debts, may be issued either successively or simultaneously as the Court directing the sale may
in each instance think proper.

251. In all cases of sale of moveable property, the price of
everylotshallbepaid foratthetimeofsale orassoon after
as the oilicer holding the sale shall direct, and in default of
such payment the property shall forthwith be  put up
and sold. On payment of the» purchase money, the ohicer
holding the sale shall grant a receipt for the same, and the
sale shall become absolute.

252. N o irregularity in the sale of moveable property under
an execution, shall vitiate the sale; but any person who may
sustain any injury by reason of such irregularity may recover
damages by a suit in Court.

253, In all cases of sale of immoveable property, the party
who is declared to be the purchaser shall be required to deposit immediately twenty-five per centum on the amount of
his bid, and in default of such deposit the property shall forthwith be again put up and sold.

254. The full amount of purchase money shall be made
good by the purchaser before sunset of the fifteenth day from
that on which the sale of the property took place, or if the
fifteenth day be a Sunday or other close holiday, then on the
first office day after the fifteenth day; and in default of payment within such -period, the deposit, after defraying the
expenses of the sale, shall be forfeited to Government, and
the property shall be resold and the defaulting purchaser shall
forfeit all claim to the property or to any part of the sum for
which it may subsequently be sold. If the proceeds of the
sale which is eventually consummated be less than the price
bid by such defaulting purchaser, the difference shall be

leviable from him under the rules for enforcing the payment
of money in satisfaction of a decree of Court.

255. Every re-sale of immoveable property in default of
payment of the purchase money shall be made after the issue

of a fresh notification in the manner and for the period prescribed for original sales.

256. No sale of immoveable property shall become absolute
until the sale has been confirmed by the Court. At any time
within thirty days from the date of the sale, application may
be made to the Court to set aside the sale on the ground of
any material irregularity in publishing or conducting the sale,
but no sale shall be set aside on the ground of such irregularity unless the applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of
the Court that he has sustained substantial injury by reason
of such irregularity.

257. If no such application as is mentioned in the last preceding section be made, or if such application be made and
the objection be disallowed, the Court shall pass an order confirming the sale; and in like manner if such application be
made, and if the objection be allowed, the Court shall pass an
order setting aside the sale for irregularity. If the objection
be allowed, the order made to set aside the sale shall be final;
if the objection be disallowed, the order confirming the sale
shall be open to appeal; and such order, unless appealed

m, and if appealed from then the order passed on the

%p)peal, shall be final; and the party against whom the same
has been given shall be precluded from bringing a suit for
Establishing his claim.

258. Whenever a sale of immoveable property is set aside,
the purchaser shall be entitled to receive back his purchase
money with or without interest, in such manner as it may
appear proper to the Court to direct in each instance.

259. After a sale of immoveable property shall have become absolute in manner aforesaid, the Court shall grant a
certificate to the person who may have been declared the
purchaser at such sale, to the effect that he has purchased the
right, title, and interest of the defendant in the property sold,
and such certificate shall be taken and deemed to be a valid
transfer of such right, title, and interest.

260. The certificate shall state the name of the person who
at the time of sale is declared to be the actual purchaser, and
any suit brought against the certified purchaser on the ground
that the purchase was made on behalf of another person not
the certified purchaser, though by agreement the name of the
certified purchaser was used, shall be dismissed with costs.

261. Where the property sold shall consist of goods, chattels, or other moveable property in the possession of the
defendant, or to the immediate possession of which the dc.»
fendant is entitled, and of which actual seizure has been
made, the property shall be delivered to the purchaser.

262. Where the property sold shall consist of goods, chattels, or other moveable property to which the defendant is
entitled subject to a lien or right of any person to the immediate possession thereof, the delivery to the purchaser shall, as
far as practicable, be made by giving notice to the person in
possession prohibiting him from delivering possession of the
property to any person except the purchaser thereof.

263. If the property sold shall consist of a house, land, or
other immoveable property, in the occupancy of a defendant
or some person on his behalf, or of some person claiming
under a title created by the defendant tubsequently to the
attachment of such property, the Court shall order delivery
thereof to be made by putting the party to whom the house,
land, or other immoveable property may have been sold, or
any person whom he may appoint to receive delivery on his
behalf, in possession thereof, and, if need be, by removing any
person who may refuse to vacate the same.

264. If the property sold shall consist of land or other immoveable property in the occupancy of ryots or other persons
entitled to occupy the same, the Court shall order delivery
thereof to be made by ailixing a copy of the certificate of sale
in some conspicuous place on the land or other immoveable
property, and proclaiming to the occupants of the property
by beat of drum, or in such other mode as may be customary,
at some convenient place or places, that the right, title, and

interest of the defendant has been transferred to the purchaser.

265. Where the property sold shall consist of debts not
being negotiable instruments or of shares in any railway,
banking, or other public company or corporation, the delivery
thereof shall be by a written order of the Court prohibiting
the creditor from receiving the debts, and the debtor from
making payment thereof to any person or persons except the
purchaser, or prohibiting the person in whose name the shares
may be standing, from making any transfer of the shares to
any person except the purchaser, or receiving payment of any
dividends thereon, and the manager, secretary, or other proper
officer of the company or corporation from permitting any
such transfer or making any such payment to any person
except the’ purchaser.

266. Where the property sold shall consist of negotiable

securities of which actual seizure has been made, the same
shall be delivered to the purchaser thereof.

267. If the endorsement or conveyance of the party in
whose name any negotiable security or any share in a public
company or corporation is standing, shall be required to
transfer the same, the Judge may endorse the security or the
certificate of the share, or may execute such other document
as may be necessary for transferring the same. The endorsement or execution shall be in the following form or to the

like effect—“ A. B. by C. D. Judge of the Court of (or as the

case may .be); in a suit by E. F. versus A. B.” Until the
transfer of such security or share, the Judge may, by order,
appoint some person to receive any interest or dividend due
thereon, and to sign receipts for the same; and any endorsement made or document executed or receipts signed as aforesaid
shall be as valid and effectual for all purposes, as if the same
had been made or executed or signed by the party himself.

268. If the purchaser of any immoveable property sold in
execution of a decree shall be resisted or obstructed in obtaining possession of the property, the provisions contained in
Sections 226, 227, and 228 relating to resistance or obstruction to a party in whose favour a suit has been decreed_in
obtaining possession of the property adjudged to him, shall
be applicable in the case of such resistance or obstruction.

269. If it shall appear that the resistance or obstruction to
the delivery of possession was occasioned by any person other
than the defendant claiming a right to the possession of the
property sold as proprietor, mortgagee, lessee, or under any
other title, or if in the delivery of possession to the purchaser
any such person claiming as aforesaid shall be 
the Court, on the complaint of the purchaser, or of such
person claiming as aforesaid, if made within one month from
the date of such resistance or obstruction or of such 
sion as the case may be, shall enquire into the matter of the
complaint and pass such order as may be proper in the circumstances of the case. The order shall not be subject to
appeal, but the party against whom it is given shall be at
liberty to bring a suit to establish his right at any time within
one year from the date thereof.

270. Whenever property is sold in execution of a decree,
the person on whose application such property was attached
shall be entitled to be first paid out of the proceeds thereof.

notwithstanding a subsequent attachment of the same property by another party in execution of a prior decree.

271. If, after the claim of the person on whose application
the property was attached has been satisfied in full from the
proceeds of the sale, any surplus remain, such surplus shall
be distributed rateably amongst any other persons who prior
to the order for such distribution may have taken out execution of decrees against the same defendant and not obtained
satisfaction thereof. . Provided that, when any property is sold

subject to a mortgage, the mortgagee shall not be entitled to
share in any surplus arising from such sale.

272. If it shall appear to the Court, upon the application
of a decree-holder, that any other decree under which property has been attached was obtained by fraud or other improper means, the Court may order that the applicant shall
be satisfied out of the proceeds of the property attached so
far as the same may suflice for the purpose if such other
decree be a decree of that Court, or, if it be a decree of

another Court, may stay the proceedings to enable the applicant to obtain a similar order from the Court by which the
decree was made.

OF ARREST IN EXECUTION OF DEGREES FOR MONEY.

273. Any person arrested under a warrant in execution
of a decree for money may, on being brought before the
Court, apply for his discharge on the ground that he has no
present means of paying the debt, either wholly or in part,
or, if possessed of any property, that he is  to place
whatever property he possesses at the disposal of the Court.
The application shall contain a full account of all property
of whatever nature belonging to the applicant, whether in
expectancy or in possession, and whether held exclusively by
himself or jointly with others, or by others in trust for him

examine the applicant in the presence of the plaintif or his
pleader as to his then circumstances, and as to his future
means of payment, and shall call upon the plaintii to show
cause why he does not proceed  any property of which
the defendant is possessed, and why the defendant should not
be  ; and should the p1aintiE fail to show such
cause, the Court may direct the discharge of the defendant
from custody. Pending any enquiry which the Court may
consider it necessary to make into the allegations of either
party, the Court may leave the defendant in the custody of
the oilicer of the Court to whom the service of the warrant
was entrusted, on the defendant  the necessary deposit
for paying the fees of such oilicer; or if the defendant furnish
good and sullicient security for his appearance at any time
when called upon while such enquiry is being made, his surety
or sureties undertaking. in default of such appearance to pay
the amount mentioned in the warrant, the Court may release
the defendant on such security.

275. The discharge of the defendant under the last preced: ing section shall not protect him h-om being arrested again and

imprisoned if it should be shown that, in the application made
by him, he had been guilty _of any concealment or of wilfully
making any false statement  the property belonging
to him, whether in possession or in expectancy or held for him
in trust, or had fraudulently concealed, ‘transferred, or removed
any property, or had committed any other act of bad faith;
nor shall such discharge exempt from attachment and sale any

property then in the possession of the defendant, or of which
he may afterwards become possessed. .. .. . ...

OF THE ‘EXECUTION OF DEGREES BY IHPBISONMENT.

276. When a defendant is committed to prison in execution
of a decree, the Court shall fix whatever monthly allowance it
shall think sufficient for his subsistence, not exceeding four
annas per day, which shall be supplied by the party at whose
instance the decree may have been executed, to the proper
otlicer of the Court or of the gaol where the defendant may
be in custody, by monthly payments in advance, before the
first day of each month; the first payment to be made for
such portion of the current month as may remain unexpired

before the defendant is committed to prison.

277. The Court may, in case of illness or for other special
cause, fix the monthly allowance at such sum not exceeding
six annas per day as shall appear necessary. The order 
such allowance may from time to time be revised and altered
on due cause being shown.

278. A defendant shall be released at any time on the
decree being fully satisfied, or at the request of the person at
whose instance he may have been imprisoned, or on such
person omitting to pay the allowance as above directed. N 0

hundred rupees, or for a longer period than three months if

the decree be for the payment of money not exceeding fifty
rupees.
279. Sums disbursed by a plaintiff for the subsistence of a

defendant in gaol shall be added to the costs of the decree,

defendant shall not be detained in custody or arrested on
account of any sums so disbursed.

280. Any person in confinement under a decree may apply
to the Court for his discharge. The application shall contain
a full account of all property of whatever nature belonging to
the applicant, whether in expectancy or in possession, and
whether held exclusively by himself or jointly with others, or
by others in trust for him (except the necessary wearing
apparel of himself and his family and the necessary implements of his trade), and of the places respectively where such
property is to be found ; and such application shall be subscribed and verified by the applicant in the manner hereinbefore provided for subscribing and verifying plaints.

281. On such application being made, the Court shall cause
the plaintiff to be furnished with a copy of the account of the
defendant’s property, and shall fix a reasonable period within
which the plaintiff may cause the whole or any part of such
property to be attached and sold or may make proof that the
defendant, for the purpose of procuring his discharge without
satisfying the decree, has wilfully concealed property, or his
right or interest therein, or fraudulently transferred or removed property, or committed any other act of bad faith. If
within such period the plaintiil’ shall fail to make such proof,
the Court shall cause the defendant to be set at liberty. If
the plaintiff shall within the time specified, or at any subsequent
period, prove to the satisfaction of the Court that the defendant
has been guilty of any of the acts abovementioned, the Court
shall, at the instance of the plaintiff, either retain the defendant in confinement, or commit him to prison, as the case
may be, unless he shall have already been in confinement two
years on account of the decree; and may also, if it shall think
proper, send the defendant to the Magistrate to be dealt with
according to law.

282. A defendant once discharged shall not again be imprisoned on account of the same decree, except under the

operation of the last preceding section, but his property shall
continue liable, under the ordinary rules, to attachment and
sale until the decree shall be fully satisfied, unless the decree
shall be for a sum less than one hundred rupees and on account of a transaction bearing date subsequently to the passing
of this Act. When the decree shall be for a sum less than
one hundred rupees, and on account of a transaction bearing
date as above, the Court may declare a defendant who shall

be  as aforesaid absolved from further liability under
that decree.

283. All questions ' regarding the amount of any mesne
proiits which by the terms of the decree may have been
reserved for adjustment in the execution of the decree, or of
any mesne protits or interest which may be made payable in
respect of the subject matter of a suit between the date of the
institution of the suit and execution of the decree, as well as
questions relating to sums alleged to have been paid in discharge or satisfaction of the decree or the like, shall be determined by order of the Court executing the decree and not by

separate suit; and the order passed by the Court shall be
open to appeal.

THE COURT BY WHICH IT WAS PASSED.

284. A decree of any Civil Court within any part of the
British territories in India, or established by the authority of

same, may be executed within the jurisdiction of any other
such Court in the manner following.

285. The plaintiff in such case may apply to the Court
whose duty it is to execute the decree, to‘ transmit a copy
thereof, together with a certificate that satisfaction of such

copies and certificates are transmitted shall cause the same to
be tiled therein, without any proof of the judgment or order

it shall, under any peculiar circumstances to be speciiied in
an order, require such proof.

287. The copy of any decree, or of any order for execution,
when tiled in the Court to which it shall have been transmitted for the purpose of being executed as aforesaid, shall
for such purpose have the same effect as a decree or order for
execution made by such Court, and may, if the Court be the
principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the district, be
executed by such Court, or any Court subordinate thereto, to
which it may entrust the execution of the same.

288. When application shall be made to any Court to
execute the decree of any other Court as aforesaid, the Court
to which the application shall be made or referred shall proceed to execute the same according to its own rules in the
like cases; provided that such Court shall have no power to

punish all wrongful acts or irregularities done or committed
in executing such decree; and all persons disobeying or obstructing the execution of such decree shall be punishable by

such Court in the same manner as if the decree had been
made by such Court.

290. The Court to which such application is made may,
upon good and suiiicient cause being shown, stay the execution of the decree for a reasonable time, to enable the defendant to apply to the Court by which the decree was passed, or
to any Court having appellate jurisdiction in respect of the
decree or the execution thereof, for an order to stay the execution, or for any other order relating to the decree or the
execution thereof, which such Court of first instance or Court
of Appeal might have made if execution had been issued by
such Court of first instance, or if application for execution
had been made to such Court; and in case the property or
person of the defendant shall have been seized under an execution, the Court which issued the execution may order the
restitution of the property or the discharge of the person of
the defendant pending the result of such application.

security from, or impose such conditions upon the defendant
as it may deem reasonable.

reason to refuse the application on any of the grounds stated
in the last preceding section, it shall fix a day (of which at
least ten days’ previous notice shall be given to the opposite
party) for receiving such evidence as the petitioner may addues in proof of his pauperism, and for hearing any evidence

as the business of the Court will permit, the Court shall eonsider any objections made by the opposite party, and shall
examine any witnesses produced by either party, and make a
memorandum of the substance of their evidence, and shall
either allow or refuse to allow the petitioner to sue as a

the suit or with the execution of any decree passed in it.

309. On the decision of the suit, the Court shall calculate

plaintilf if he had not been permitted to sue as a pauper, and
such amount shall be recoverable by Government from any

party ordered by the decree to pay the same, in the same
manner as costs of suit are recoverable.

310. The refusal to allow the petitioner to sue as a pauper

shall be a bar to any subsequent application of the like nature in respect of the same cause of action; but the plaintiii‘

REFERENCE TO ARBITRATION.

312. IF the parties to a suit are desirous that the matters
in difference between them in the suit, or any of such matters, shall be referred to the final decision of one or more
arbitrator or arbitrators, they may apply to the Court at any
time before final judgment for an order of reference.

313. The application shall he made by the parties in person, or by their pleaders, specially authorized in that behalf
by an instrument in writing, which shall be presented to the
Court at the time of making the application, and shall be filed
with the proceedings in the suit.

314. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall be nominated by
the parties in such manner as may be agreed upon between
them. If the parties cannot agree with respect to the nomination of the arbitrator or arbitrators, or if the person or
persons nominated by them shall refuse to accept the arbitration, and the parties are desirous that the nomination shall
be made by the Court, the Court shall appoint the arbitrator
or arbitrators.

315. The Court shall, by an order under its seal, refer to
the arbitrator or arbitrators the matters in difference in the
suit which he or they may be required to determine, and shall
fix such time as it may think reasonable for the delivery of

the award, and the time so fixed shall be specified in the
order.

316. If the reference be to two or more arbitrators, provision shall be made in the order for a diiference of opinion
among the arbitrators, by the appointment of an umpire, or

by declaring that the decision shall be with the majority, or
by empowering the arbitrators to appoint an umpire, or otherwise as may be agreed upon between the parties; or if they
cannot agree, as the Court may determine

317. When a reference is made to arbitration by an order
of Court, the Court shall issue the same processes to the
parties and witnesses whom the arbitrator or arbitrators or
umpire may desire to have examined, as the Court is authorized to issue in suits tried before it; and persons not
attending in consequence of such process, or making any
other default, or refusing to give their testimony, or being
guilty of any contempt to the arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire during the investigation of the suit, shall be subject to
the like disadvantages, penalties, and punishments, by order
of the Court on the representation of the arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, as they would incur for the same offences in
suits tried before the Court.

318. When the arbitrator or arbitrators shall not have been
able to complete the award within the period specified in the
order, from the want of the necessary evidence or information,
or other good and sufficient cause, the Court may from time
to time enlarge the period for the delivery of the award, if it
shall think proper. In any case in which an umpire shall
have been appointed, it shall be lawful for him to enter on
the reference in lieu of the arbitrators, if they shall have
allowed their time or their extended time to expire without
making an award, or shall have delivered to the Court or to
the umpire a notice in writing stating that they cannot
agree. Provided that an award shall not be liable to be set
aside only by reason of its not having been completed within
the period allowed by the Court, unless on proof that the
delay in completing the award arose from corruption or misconduct of the arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, or unless
the award shall have been made after the issue of an order

by the Court superseding the arbitration and recalling the
suit.

319. If, in any case of reference to arbitration by an order
of Court, the arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire shall die, or
refuse or become incapable to act, it shall be lawful for the
Court to appoint a new arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, in
the place of the person or persons so dying, or refusing or
becoming incapable to act. Where the arbitrators are empowered by the terms of the order of reference to appoint an
umpire and do not appoint an umpire, any of the parties may
serve the arbitrators with a written notice to appoint an umpire; and if within seven days after such notice shall have
been served, no umpire be appointed, it shall be lawful for
the Court, upon the application of the party having served
such notice as aforesaid, and upon proof to its satisfaction of
such notiw having been served, to appoint an umpire. In
any case of appointment under this section, the arbitrator or
arbitrators, or umpire so appointed, shall have the like power
to act in the reference, as if their name or names had been
inserted in the original order of reference.

320. When an award in a suit shall be made either by the
arbitrator or arbitrators, or by the umpire, it shall be submitted to the Court under the signature of the person or
persons by whom it may be made, together with all the proceedings, depositions, and exhibits in the suit.

321. It shall be lawful for the arbitrator or arbitrators or
umpire, upon any reference, by an order of Court if he or
they shall think fit, and if it is not provided to the contrary,
to state his or their award as to the whole or any part thereof, in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Court.

322. The Court may, on the application of either party,
modify or correct an award where it appears that a part of

the award is upon matters not referred to the arbitrators, pro- vided such part can be separated from the other part, and

does not effect the decision on the matter referred; or where
the award is imperfect in form, or contains any obvious error
which can be amended without aEecting such decision. The
Court may also on such application make such order as it
thinks just respecting the costs of the arbitration, if any
question arise respecting such costs and the award contain no
suliicient provision concerning them.

323. In any of the following cases the Court shall have
power to remit the award or any of the matters referred to

arbitration to the reconsideration of the same arbitrator or
arbitrators or umpire, upon such terms as it may think proper
(that is to say)If the award has left undetermined some of the matters
referred to arbitration, or if it determine matters not referred
to arbitration.

If the award is so indefinite as to be incapable of execution.

If an objection to the legality of the award is apparent upon
the face of the award.

324. No award shall be liable to be set aside except on
the ground of corruption or misconduct of the arbitrators or
umpire. Any application to set aside an award shall be
made within ten days after the same has been submitted to
the Court.

325. If the Court shall not see cause to remit the award or
any of the matters referred to arbitration for reconsideration
in manner aforesaid, and if no application shall have been
made to set aside the award, or if the Court shall have refused
such application, the Court shall proceed to pass judgment
according to the award, or according to its own opinion on
the special case if the award shall have been submitted to it
in the form of a special case; and upon the judgment which
shall be so given decree shall follow and shall be carried into
execution in the same manner as other decrees of the Court.

In every case in which judgment shall be given according to
the award, the judgment shall be final.

326. When any persons shall by an instrument in writing
agree that any diderences between them or any of them
shall be referred to the arbitration of any person or persons
named in the agreement, or to be appointed by any Com-t
having jurisdiction in the matter to which it relates, application may be made by the parties thereto, or any of them, that
the agreement be filed in such Court. On such application
being made, the Court shall direct such notice to be given to
any of the parties to the agreement, other than the applicants, as it may think necessary, requiring such parties to
show cause, within a time to be specified, why the agreement
should not be filed. The application shall be written on a
stamp paper of one-fourth of the value prescribed for plaints
in suits, and shall be numbered and registered as a suit
between some or one of the parties interested or  to
be interested as plaintiffs or plaintiff, and the others or other
of them as defendants or defendant, if the application have
been presented by all the parties, or, if otherwise, between
the applicant as plaintiff, and the other parties as defendants.
If no suilicient cause be shown against the agreement, the
agreement shall be filed and an order of reference to arbitration shall be made thereon. The several provisions of this
chapter, so far as they are not inconsistent with the terms of

any agreement so filed, shall be applicable to all proceedings
under an order of reference made by the Court, and to the

award of arbitration and to the enforcement of such award.

327. When any matter has been referred to arbitration
without the intervention of any Court of Justice, and an award
has been made, any person interested in the award may, within
six months from the date of the award, make application

to the Court having jurisdiction in the matter to which the
award relates, that the award be filed in Court. The Court

shall direct notice to be given to the parties to the arbitration
other than the applicant, requiring such parties to show
cause, within a time to be specified, why the award should
not be filed. The application shall be written on the stamp
paper required for petitions to the Court where a stamp is
required for petitions by any law for the time being in force,
and shall be numbered and registered as a suit between the
applicant as plaintiff and the other parties as defendants. If

no sullicient cause be shown  the award, the award
shall be filed, and may be enforced as an award made under
the provisions of this chapter.
