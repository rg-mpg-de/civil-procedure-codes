such delay. No cause shall be delayed by reason of an amendment, excepting only the time to made up issues, but upon goodcause shown by afhdavit of the party or his attorney asking such.
dela .

§ 61. The affidavit shallshow distinctly in what respect

such case, they must serve notice of the appeal upon all the other
co-parties, and file the proof thereof with the clerk of the Supreme

which the first levy is made shall have the preference, and all
liens created by the prior delivery of any other execution shall ‘be

divested in favor of the execution first levied.
§ 14. If the sheriff die or go out of office before the

parcel thereof, sold as aforesaid, shall be redeemed by the owner:
or any part owner or persons claiming under them as above pro-1»:
vided, the sale thereof by the sh'eriff shall be wholly vacated as to
the real estate, interest therein or part thereof redeemed, and

But whenever real estate or an interest therein has been sold by
the sheriff as aforesaid, no re-sale thereofshall be had upon execution or decretal order issued upon any judgment or flefiree. JUNO!’

from the date of such sale, unless the same shall have been previously redeemed by the owner or part owner, or some one claiming under either, as above provided.

§ 96. In the absence of a redemption as above provi-_

ded, by. any owner, part owner, or person claiming under either, m

the real estate sold, or any parcel or parcels thereof sold in one

body, may be redeemed at any time within one year from the date
of sale, by any judgment-creditor, his executors, administrators,
or assigns holding a judgment or decree against the defendant
whose title or interest shall have been sold, which, at the time he
or they offer to redeem, shall be a lien upon such title or interest,
and which shall be junior to the judgment under which the property was sold. Such redemption made by any person entitled
thereto, without regard to the order of priorities of liens, and successive redemptions may be made by the several persons entitled
to redeem, in the manner hereinafter provided.

§ 97. Any judgment-creditor authorized by the preceding section to redeem, who shall desire to redeem from the purchaser at such sale, shall‘ first file with the clerk of the court in
whose office the certificate of purchase is required to be recorded
a statement, duly verified by his afiidavit, or the afiidavit of his
agent or attorney, showing the court in which his judgment was
rendered, the parties thereto, amount and date thereof, and amount
due and unpaid thereon, and, if less than the whole, the parcel or
parcels thereof which he desires to redeem and the sale from which
he desires to redeem. He shall thereupon pay to ‘such clerk,
for the use of the purchaser, his executor, administrator, or assigns, the amount paid by such purchaser for the real estate or
portion thereof sought to be redeemed, as shown by the record of
the certificate of purchase in the “Lis Pendens Record" in the
ofiice of said clerk, and interest at the rate of eight per cent
per annum thereon from the date of his purchase. Upon the receipt of the redemption money and interest. the clerk shall make
out and sign a certificate showing the date and amount of the redemption, the land or part thereof redeemed, the judgment in right
of which the redemption was made, and the execution under
which the sale was made; and, after recording such statement, affidavit, and certificate “Lis Pendens Record" shall deliver such certificate to the redemptioner. When such redemption has been made,
any other judgment-creditor, entitled and wishing to redeem, may
do so by filing with said clerk a statement and afiidavit similar to
those above provided for and containing, in addition. the name of
the preceding redemptioner from whom he wishes to redeem, and
the particular parcels he wishes to redeem. He shall thereupon
pay to such clerk, for the use of the last preceding redemptioner.
if the lien of the latter be junior to that of the party now redeeming, his redemption money and interest at the rate of eight per
cent per annum thereon and costs of redemption; anclif his lien be
senior to that of the party seeking to redeem, he shall pay to the
clerk, for the use of the aforesaid, the judgment of the last redemptioner on account of which his redemption was made and interest thereon and his costs of suit in addition to the amounts aforesaid; and thereupon such clerk shall issue to him a certificate similar to the one above provided for, and record the statement, affidavit, and certificate in the “Lis Pendens Record" aforesaid.

Supsequent redemptions may be made by other judgment-creditors
entitled to redeem, substantially in the manner and upon the

" terms above provided; and when the redemption of any parcel is

made from a prior redemption, the amount to be paid by the redemptioner shall be in the same proportion as provided in section 4790. When any person claims the right as the executor,
administrator, or assignee of a judgment-plaintiff, to redeem, he
shall file a verified statement of the facts, showing his right to redeem; and if his right to redeem is based upon records other than
those in the office of the clerk where such redemption is made, he
shall file certified copies of such records with his statement; all of
which shall be properly endorsed and filed by the clerk.

§ 98. If, during the year hereinbefore allowed for redemption, the real estate, or interest therein, sold by the sheriff,
or any parcel or parcels thereof sold separately, shall be redeemed
by any owner or part owner or by any person claiming under
them, at the expiration of such year, the last redemptioner shall
be immediately thereafter entitled to sue out an execution in the
nature of a vena’z'tz'om' exporzas upon his judgment, by virtue of which
he made his redemption. Such execution shall recite the judgment upon which the original sale was made, naming the court,
wherein rendered, the parties thereto, the date and amount thereof
the dates of the execution and sale, and name of the owner, the
price paid by the purchaser or purchasers for the real estate, if
sold in one body, or for each parcel thereof, if sold in parcels, or
interest therein redeemed by said redemptioner, the amount paid
by such redemptioner in redemption thereof, date of payment, and
costs of redemption, and the judgment of said redemptioner,
under which his redemption was made and amount due threon;
which execution shall issue to the sheriff of the county in which
such real estate is situate, commanding him to sell the real estate,
interest therein, or parcels thereof, redeemed by said redemptioner, to the highest bidder; and after paying the costs of such
sale, and paying to such redemptioner his redemption money and
interest thereon at the rate of eight per cent per annum, and his
cost of redemption, and the amount of principal, interest and costs
due on his judgment, pay the residue into the olhce of the clerk
issuing such execution. Such real estate shall be sold upon like

‘notice as in other cases, but without offering the rents and profits,
and without regard to appraisement laws, and if redeemed. in
parcels shall be offered in like parcels, and the redemptioner suing
out such execution shall be deemed the bidder for the amount
paid by him in redemption thereof, and interest thereon at the
rate of eight per cent per annum, his costs of redemption and the
costs of sale, and if no one bid more, he shall be deemed the purchaser for that amount, and the sheriff shall immediately upon the
perfecting of such sale, execute to the purchaser a conveyance of
the premises, which shall convey to the purchaser all.the title and
interest of the owner sold under the original execution. If such
sale should fail to satisfy the execution in full, the residue may be
levied and collected of any other property of the defendant theret0. as in other cases. If the execution upon the Judgmellt Of
the last redemptioner be stayed at the expiration of the year
aforesaid, or there be installments on his judgment or decree, not

then due, he shall, nevectheless, be entitled to execution as aforesaid, for the amount due him on account of his redemption, which
shall be without prejudice to his right to sue out further Final process on his judgment or decree, and any surplus remaining, after
satisfying the costs of sale and amount due him on account of re_demption, shall be paid to the ‘clerk for distribution, as hereinafter
provided. Such sale shall discharge the lien of the judgment on
which the original sale was made, and the .liens of all intervening
judgments and decrees; and if any surplus remain after satisfying
the execution upon the last sale, it shall be distributed by the
court from whence said execution issued, among the judgment
creditors whose liens are junior to that under which the original sale
was made, according to their original priorities and equities. If
the judgment on which such execution issues shall have been rendered in a court other than that in the clerk’s office of which the
statement, affidavitfand certificate of such last redemptioner are
required to be filed, he shall before the issuing of such execution,
procure duly certified copies of such statement, affidavit and certificate, and cause them to be Filed and recorded in the “Lis Pendens

Be it enacted by t/ze Legz'slatz'zre Assembly of I/ze Territory of Of!la/zoma:

§ 1. When a person qualified under the laws of the United States to make legal settlement upon public lands in Oklahoma
has in good faith settleo upon land or town lots, while the same
was a part of the public domain of the United States, and made
valuable improvements thereon, under such circumstances as to
give him good reason to believe, and in addition thereto if he did
believe, that he had a right to improve the land or lots so settled
upon, and in any contest before the land departments to which
the occupant, or any of his assignors, were parties by themselves or by trustees or agents acting for the settlers on the
land in dispute, or if in an action in court to remove the settler
from the land or lots, he is found not to be entitled to the same he
shall not be removed therefrom until his rights as occupying
claimant are adjusted and his improvements paid for as in this act
provided.

§ 2. When an occupant of land or lots other than public domain has color of title thereto, and has in good faith made
any valuable improvements thereon and is afterwards in any
action found not to be the rightful owner thereof, he shall not be
deprived of the possession of the property until the provisions of
this act have been complied with.

§ 3. Any person occupying land or lots as provided in section one or two, shall be allowed sixty days after the final determination that he is not entitled to the possession of the same,
in which to file his petition for the recovery of the value of the
improvements by him so made_ upon the land or lots, which petition must be filed ‘in the office of the clerk of the district court
of the county in which the land or lots is located, and during
said sixty days no execution shall issue for his removal therefrom, or the occupying claimant may file his petition as a counterclaim in any action at law brought against him to recover the
land or lots, but such counter-claim shall not be tried until there

is a finding that the occupying claimant is not entitled to the
land or lots in controversy. , l .

§ 4. Such petition or counter-claim must set forth the
ground on which the occupying claimant seeks relief, stating the
judgment or finding of the land officers of the United States
against him, or judgment of the proper court and stating as accurately as possible the circumstances under which he improved
the land or lots and the value of the improvements upon the land
or lots as well as the value of the same apart from the improvements.

§ 5. Summons shall issue and be served, and issues
thereon shall be joined and the cause be tried as in ordinary

actions, and if the value of the land or lots or improvements is in
controversy, the separate value of each must be ascertained and
fixed by the verdict of the jury and judgment of the court, and the
costs in such cases may be apportioned in such manner as the
courts may deem just and proper.

§ 6. The claimant to the land or lots may thereupon‘
pay into court the value of the improvements as fixed by the
judgment and take the property; should he fail to do this after a
reasonable time, to be fixed by the court, the plaintiff maytake
the property upon paying the value of the land or lots aside from
the improvements. '

§ 7. If this be not done in a reasonable time, to be‘
fixed by the court, the parties will be held to be tenants in common
of the land or lots including the improvements, each holding an
interest proportionate to the value of his property as ascertained
by the judgment, and may maintain action for partition as between themselves.

§ 8. The purchaser in good faith at any judicial or tax
sale made by the proper officer, has color of title within the
meaning of this act, whether such person or oliicer has sufficient
authority to sell or not, unless such want of authority was known
to such person at the time of the sale. The rights of such purchaser shall pass to his assignee or representatives in. all cases.

§ 9. Any person has also such color of title who has p:
occupied the tract of land or lots by himself, or by those under
whom he claims, for the term of live years, if he or those under
whom he claims have at any time during such occupancy with
the knowledge or consent expressed or implied of the real owner
made any valuable improvements thereon, or if he or those ‘under
whom he claims have at any time during such occupancy paid the
ordinary taxes assessed by the county for any one year, and two
years thereafter have elapsed without the payment or proffer of
repayment of the same by the owner of the land or lots, and such
occupancy is continued up to the time suit 1s.bro.uglit_ in which
the recovery of the same is obtained; but nothing in this act shall
be construed to give tenants color of title against their landlords.

§ 10. If the value of the improvements, as found by
the judgment, be paid by the claimant of the land or lots, he shall?‘
be entitled to an order and execution for the 13055635103 Of ll“?
same.

§ 11. If the occupying claimant pay the value of the
land or lots as fixed by the judgmemt, the cause shall be docketed
and proceeded with at the next term of court, without further notice, and a decree entered quieting the title to the land or lots in
the occupying claimant, his heirs or assigns. .

§ 12. The occupying claimant shall not recover for
the improvements made upon the land or lots after the same
has been awarded to the adverse party, but he may recover for
all improvements made in good faith before such adjudication is
had.

§ 13. The claimant of the land or _lots shall be entitled to the rental value of the same in the condition it was
before any improvements of the occupying claimant were placed thereon, which rental value may be set off against the value
of the improvements at the time of the trial, and the judgment shall be for the value of the improvements less the rental
value so found. ‘

§ 1. Any party dissatisfied with a judgment rendered.
in a civil action in a justice’s court, may appeal therefrom to the f}
district court of the county or subdivision at any time within
thirty days after the rendition of the judgment. The appeal is
taken by serving a copy of the notice of appeal on the adverse
party or his attorney, and by filing the notice of appeal with the
justice. The notice must state whether the appeal is taken from
the whole or a part of the judgment; and if from a part, what part,
and whether the appeal is taken on questions of law or fact, or
both.

§ 2. When a party appeals to the district court on
questions of law alone, or desiring a review therein,’ upon the evi- q.
dence appearing on the trial below, either of questions of facts or 3
law, he must, within ten days from the rendition of judgment,
prepare a statement of the case and file the same with the
justice. The statement must contain the grounds upon which
the party intends to rely on the appeal. and 50 much Of the
evidence as may be necessary to explain the grounds, and I10
more. Within ten days after he receives notice that the state-ment is med, the adverse party, if dissatisfied with the same,
may file amendments. The proposed statement and amendments
must be settled by the justice, and if no amendments be filed the

original statement stands as adopted. The statement thus adopted or as settled by the justice, with a copy of the docket of the
justice, and all motions filed with him by the parties during the
trial and the notice of appeal, may be used on the hearing of the
appeal before the district court. ‘

§ 3. When a party appeals to the district court on
questions of fact, or on question of both law and fact, and demands in his notice of appeal a new trial in the district court, no
statement must be made, but the action must be tried anew in
that court.

§ 4. Upon receiving the notice of appeal, and on'

payment of one dollar for the return of the justice, and filing an
undertaking as required in the next section, and after settlement
or adoption of statement, if any, the justice must within five days
transmit to the clerk of the district, if the appeal be on questions
of fact or both law and fact, and a new trial in the district court
be demanded in the notice of appeal a certified copy of his docket,
the pleadings, all notices, motions and other papers filed in the
cause, the notice of appeal and the undertaking filed; in all other
cases a certified copy of his docket, the statement as admitted or
as settled, the notice of appeal and the undertaking filed; and the
justice may be compelled by the district court, by an order entered,
upon motion, to transmit such papers and may be fined for
neglect or refusal to transmit the same. A certified copy of such
order may be served on the justice by the party or his attorney.
In the district court either party may have the benefit of all legal
objections made in the justice’s court.

§ 5. An appeal from a justice’s court is not effectual
for any purpose, unless an undertaking be filed, with two or more
sureties. in the sum of one hundred dollars, for the payment of the
costs on the appeal; or if a stay of proceedings be claimed, in a sum
equal to twice the amount of the judgment, including costs, when
the judgment is for the payment of money; or twice the value of the
property, including costs, when the judgment is for the recovery of
specific personal property, and must be conditioned, when the action
is for the recovery of money, that the appellant will pay the amount
of the judgment appealed from and all costs, if the appeal be withdrawn or dismissed, or the amount of any judgment and all costs
that may be recovered against him in the action in the district court.
When the action is for the recovery of specific personal property
the undertaking must be conditioned that the appellant will pay
the judgment and costs appealed from, and obey the order of the
court made therein, if the appeal be withdrawn or dismissed, or any
judgment and costs that may be recovered against him in said action
in the district court, and will obey any order made by the court
therein. A deposit of the amount of the judgement, including all
costs appealed from, or of the value of the property, including all
costs in actions for the recovery of specific personal property, with
the justice, is equivalent to the filing of the undertaking, and in
such cases the justice must transmit the money to the clerk of the
district court, to be by him paid out on the order of the court.

adverse party, to the amounts stated in their afiidavits, the appeal
must be regarded as if no such undertaking had been given.

executed on the part of the appellant, with two orrmore sureties,

to the effect that during the possession of such property by the

appellant he will not commit or suffer to be committed any waste
thereon, and that if the judgment be affirmed, or the appeal be dismissed, he will pay all rents for the use and occupation of the
property, and all damages from the time of the appeal until the
delivery of the possession thereof.

§ 7. If an execution be issued, on the filing of the undertaking staying proceedings, the justice must, by order, direct
the oliicer to stay all proceedings on the same. Such officer must,
upon payment of his fees for the services rendered on the execution, thereupon relinquish all property levied upon, and deliver
the same to the judgment debtor, together with allmoneys collected from sales or otherwise. If his fees be not paid, the officer may
retain so much of the property or proceeds thereof as may be
necessary to pay the same.

§ 8. Upon an appeal heard upon a statement of the,
case, the district court may review all orders affecting the judg-'
ment appealed from, and may set aside, aHirm or modify the
judgment, or any or allithe proceedings subsequent to or dependent upon such judgment, and may, if necessary or proper, order
a new trial. When the action is tried anew, upon appeal, the trial
must be conducted in all respects as trials in the district court.
The provisions of civil procedure as to changing the place of trial,
and all the provisions as to trials in’ the district court, are applicable to trials on appeal in that court. For a failure to prosecute
an appeal, or unnecessary delay in bringing it to a hearing, the
district court, after notice, may order the appeal to be dismissed.
Judgments rendered in the district court on appeal, have the same
force and effect, and may be enforced in the district court in the
same manner, as judgments in actions commenced therein, except
that when a new trial is granted the case must be remanded, and
the new trial shall be had in the justice’s court. No notice of trial
and note of issue shall be required to be served or filed in order to
bring the cause appealed upon the trial calendar in the district
court, but said appeal shall be filed by the clerk, on paymentof
his costs, and entered upon the calendar, and shall stand for trial
as soon as the same is reached in the regular call of the calendar
thereafter. If not so filed within fifteen days from the time such
appeal was perfected, then the same shall be dismissed by the
order of the court at any time thereafter, upon motion of the
appellee, after three days notice to the appellant or his attorney.
