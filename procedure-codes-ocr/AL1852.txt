defendant in execution, and liable to its satisfaction.

§ 2589. U n the trial of the issue, the burthen of proof

the amount of the judgment of the plaintiff, if that is less
than the value of the property as assessed by the jury, or for

claim; and make true copies of the bond and affidavit, which
he must return with the execution. He must also make a
true copy of the execution, and the returns thereon, which,

of property, does not revent the plaintiff from levying on
other property of the efendant in execution.
